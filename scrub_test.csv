"Hey r/Drugs! r/TripSit here! As you may know, TripSit.me has created and shared a drug interaction chart for many years. - ([https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/File:Combo\\\_2.png](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/File:Combo_2.png)).

We are excited to share that we're expanding this chart again and adding more drugs to the chart.

But that's not all! We're also working on consolidating our drug database and creating a dynamic combo chart option.

We would love any input and help that we can get. From developers who want to help with the code to people down to help aggregate trip reports, there is a lot to be done and we would appreciate any help that we can get!

"Beginning of another day is done and 

My stim fap and put both heads down in shame....the suns I'm my face and there's a bunch of healthy runners and Mexicans mowing grass. Birds chirping , I shake and look for vodka put my shades on and hit the public restroom. Mainly to look like im doing something to people around me. My hair is a sham rag, my skin is left underneath my 1inch fingernails like butter, and I smell like I have a cat piss fetish. I have eaten probably the equivalent of 2 regular sober meals a week. Im  boofing now....i smell bad. Did i say that? But dammit I'm alive so there's always a chance to still  fuck a seahorse. 

Hey mom look what I can do!

"Need help. I've been through it all. Trauma and every addiction under the sun. How do I get myself to want to be sober man?

I've tried the sober way. Therapy. Exercise. All that shit. I keep coming back. How do I want to want to be sober?

I've been through every rock bottom and almost died a few times. What the fuck do I do? 

For context, I was raped as a kid for years on end. Therapy didn't help. I can't have sex or even jerk off without being on substances or alcohol. And I have a compulsion to jerk off. I just want to have a normal life. I go about my day then just want to jerk off and it inevitably leads me to using something just so I'm able to do it. I've tried being abstinent and I can't do it just because I get so angry I have to go through this while the pedo rapist who did this to me gets to lead a normal life. Nothing helps. What do I do?

"So, i started taking (recreational) drugs for parties when i was almost 18. I’m 23 now and I’ve noticed that the effect is VERY different. And I don’t think it’s because of tolerance, because i don’t really do them THAT often.

When I started, they gave me so much energy, and I loved going to raves and staying there till 9 am and still wanting to go on. I loved dancing and it was just really fun.

But lately I noticed that whatever drug I do (mdma, x, coke, speed etc), i don’t get the energy that I used to. I still love dancing, but I’m just too tired i guess. Lately whenever i take something I want to just sit somewhere and talk and not move. It’s weird because i think i do get the energy (obvs cause i cant fall asleep and stuff) but just a very different kind of energy, if u get what im saying. I will go to a rave and I would wanna dance, but then I get into the club and I’m just annoyed because of the crowdiness, no ventilation, people being weird etc. So I just go outside and talk for the majority of the rave. It’s weird, because when i take ecstasy, it’s like my legs are saying that i have a lot of energy, but my brain just doesnt comprehend that and it’s telling me that im tired. I dont think it’s an issue of sleep, cause i get 7-10 hours of sleep everyday. I also don’t think it’s work, i go to work like once a week as i am a student.

I guess the problem I have is i’m still young, so i would still like to enjoy the parties until it’s too late to do so. Does anyone have any suggestions or similar experiences? I knew it was bound to happen at some point, but not that soon.",non-stigmatizing,clear
"Drugs are your friends. When you suddenly have back pain. You can't get a good job. You have to study IT 8 hours a day. You live with your 80 year old parents. You haven't had a girlfriend in 7 years.

At least you have your 80mg of methadone, 1mg of real alprazolam; 30mg of vyvanse and about a quarter gram to a half gram of dabs and e cigarettes. If youre lucky you have klonz too.

Sometimes when you're feeling adventurous you drop about 100-200 mics of LSD on the weekends.

The secret is, never drink alcohol. Don't smoke cigarettes except when you're high on downers. Never do heroin or coke. Don't do benzos. In Fact don't do drugs.

That shit makes life too fun.

Microdose at least twice a week.

"Was at a party the other night and split a gram of k with my buddy. It was the first time I’ve ever done lines and we goy through the whole bag in the night 
Had 4 friends all slapping my leg as hard as they could , didn’t feel a thing. Got them to punch my arm as hard as they could again didn’t feel a thing ",non-stigmatizing,clear
"A lot of people would say GHB, Ketamine, N2O. But for me I feel like I never experienced a tolerance to Alcohol even though it's the drug that I use the most. What drug do you feel has an extremely low tolerance potential? ",non-stigmatizing,clear
We’ve been together for about 8 months now and since I’ve known him he’s done nitrous on and off. I did it with him at first then quickly realized it was a huge problem for him. I stopped doing it and he continued. He would go into a rage sometimes while doing it to the point where I would have to go home because he would be so angry and take it out on me. I told him to quit doing the nitrous and long story short he has lied to me multiple times about doing it. Pretending that he is better then I would find ten tanks in his closet. I tried so hard to help him and he is not well in the head. Am I an asshole for leaving him? I don’t want him to get hurt but I cannot help him. It is out of my scope and it was taking a huge mental toll on me. I just hope he gets better it hurts me to see someone I care for doing that. ,stigmatized,clear
