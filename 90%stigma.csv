"Finally a sane response in this thread. It seems like there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a huge misunderstanding of how much support there is when someone‚Äö√Ñ√¥s homeless. 

Addiction treatment is severely underfunded, it takes weeks/months to get into a vch funded bed at most centers. And a lot of the time it isnt feasible at all. 

Like sometimes it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a several hour window when someone is actually willing to quit, so we need to be able to get them a bed in that time. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not like you can just send someone to treatment and have them get better, they have to want it and be willing to work for it. So having a system that has enough capacity that someone can get in immediately is essential, currently the only way to get in immediately is to have 5-10k lying around, which most addicts don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have. 

For example TWC, which is supposed to be a non-profit basically only takes in people on welfare beds if they know someone who works there, or are able to pay 10k for the first month. Then the staff offer to be sober coaches for another 2k a month, preying on people who are desperate to get sober. And if someone relapsed while they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re there on government assistance they have to pay another 5-10k to get back in. Its a place that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s supposed to be helping people, but seems to be morally bankrupt.

If places like TWC can take government money with such little oversight clearly the system is a little broken. We need more treatment centers and they need to not have such a detrimental focus on profit.",98.11,1.89,Is discriminatory,t3_um9dfm,8,7

It's a process and if someone's too strung out to engage in that process and has no interest in it, you spin your wheels, spend a lot of money and make absolutely zero progress. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen case workers health care providers, doctors, begging for clients to be arrested for their shitty behavior. The hope is they might have a couple days of no use to make any headway. At least where I practice there is zero capacity to force treatment on people so we spend a lot of money, do a whole lot of work, for worse outcomes.

It has never made any sense to me why we force schizophrenics to take anti-psychotics or keep demented old people in locked facilities... But allow mentally ill destitute addicts to ""make their own health choices ."" And then allow entire communities to be overrun with dangerous antisocial behavior all under the guise of being harm reduction based. I've never been convinced that handing a destitute addict a needle and saying it's all going to be fine is appropriate, it's a lie. It's not caring. It's not kind. It's not helpful.

For instance, the canadian law allows for 4 plants to be grown. That number can be reduced by the provincial government, but they cannot ignore/cancel the law.

"It's a complicated issue. What good is it for the police to arrest someone if they'll get nearly condition-less bail the next day and then  have the case dropped by the Crown or simply get sentenced to probation despite already being on probation? One of the major problems is that there is a game of catch and release going on by the courts and Crown, part of which is because a stated goal of the system is to reduce incarceration of people from marginalized communities (incl. addicts and people with mental health challenges). The police know they can arrest the guy, waste two hours in paperwork, and have the same guy doing the same thing tomorrow. So they prioritize arresting people who are more likely to be remanded and see time. The justice system tries to be progressive, while our programs for addiction and mental health are inadequate, and nobody wants to tolerate the idea of compelling treatment. So you can't put them in jail because it's a health issue and therefore not a criminal issue (the perspective of the justice system), but you can't treat them like a health issue without express consent which they don't want to give (how many addicts are willing to volunteer for treatment and stick through with it on a wholly voluntary basis?), so they fall through the gaps.

Blame the cops if you want, but please blame Parliament for its 1995 sentencing ""reforms"" that codified principles of sentencing that involve lessening sentencing to account for marginalization and for codifying an unlimited right to bail, the judges for interpreting those laws to the maximum benefit of offenders and to the detriment of the public, prosecutors for misusing their discretion against the public interest, the province for not funding adequate mental health and  addictions treatment, and society for being uncomfortable  compelling treatment for untreated addiction and mental health even where the person is a clear risk to themselves AND others.",93.51,6.49,Is discriminatory,t3_yhagv6,3,2

The quality of the service should not depend on what you eat or drink or any preconceived amount of tip.  The servers never know who is paying.  And I would absolutely not hesitate to give 0% but have gone as high as 25%.  But to have a server pull crap like loudly announcing her thoughts about my tipping, I would have ignored her.

It's unfortunate because I have heard land owners specifically say we need CPT to make their land viable for development.

Yet the same department says that we can assess local improvements on ""benefitting properties"" because their property becomes more valuable.

So, if I want a sidewalk in front of my house, or for the city to improve my back lane from gravel, I have to pay for it because my property value improves, but if the city builds regional infrastructure the land speculators don't have to pay for that value increase. Seems legit.

"Hi!

I have some strong views on gambling.

As a libertarian (you should be free to do what you like as long as no one is forcefully harmed by your actions) I do not gamble, but don't think it is my business to restrict others from their choices.

I see gambling as ""voluntary taxation"", and I don't think it is a wise use of resources.

Does someone want to take $100 and spend it on a fancy meal as entertainment?  Great, you do you.  Does someone else want to spend $100 at the casino for entertainment?  Fine, be free.

One thing that ""grinds my gears"" is when my volunteer work with the food bank has me working hard to help others afford groceries, and then I see them blow $100 on ALC products.  They are free to spend their money as they wish, but this one makes me a little annoyed.

Same thing with welfare recipients who complain their check is not enough (I agree) but then spend money foolishly on ALC products or weed or alcohol.  Again, they are free to spend their money as they wish, but my sympathy for their financial woes quickly disappears.

Here are some things I have learned.

* People gamble because they like the feeling (reward) they get as they are playing.  They are not addicted to winning, but to the thrill of gambling.

* People sometimes give me tickets as a gift (Christmas, birthday) and I thank them for their kindness.  That said, I wish they kept their money.

* If I could vote for legislation that people on welfare were not allowed to use that money for ALC products, weed or alcohol, I would, **even though it goes against my basic libertarian philosophy.**  (Stop using my tax $$ for ALC products.)",91.3,8.7,Is discriminatory,t3_17ags3m,6,1

1. the swab doesn't test for thc, it test for metabolites.

3. after smoking thc levels in the blood drop down to under 2ng after 4 hours.

4. testing everyone who tests positive for thc using the swab would not be an effective use of police resources because a good deal of people who test positive for thc using the swab would not have enough thc in their blood to charge them with a dui.

5. government employees often get bonuses or raises for meeting targets. if you grow your department, agency, division you can argue you have more responsibility and deserve more money. this incentive distorts governance. look at alberta, the government has told municipalities it cannot put in speed cameras without scientific evidence that it reduces accidents as well.

6. cops make 30-50k of their salary in overtime. you are going to not be getting overtime if you do not perform your job to the expectations of your superiors. this can incentivize police officers to group-think and conform to unjust applications of their power.

Also.... So many questions. So both this person and their home support worker are addicts? Did I read that right? Who takes care of the kid when they are getting high? Knowing addicts I am sure as fuck that they don't take turns. Can you imagine what that poor kid has seen?

So this person wants drugs to take home so they can get home as get fucked up for the rest of the day starting at 1pm? Nice! Surprised they don't want the city to DoorDash their fix directly to their free housing. 

Hate to say it but from her own words these two have failed at every attempt to get clean. So that kid is likely fucked up due to all the drugs used during pregnancy. 

Fuck that. Free housing, and free drugs without supervision is not the reward you get for being an utter failure at life. Don't be fooled by the sob story. 

All their friends are dead due to drugs, their kid was fucked up due to getting high during pregnancy, and she admits that her kid is as severe risk when left alone while she waits for her next fix. 

This person only gives a shit about themselves. Anyone can get clean if they want it. Clearly they don't want a chance at a decent life with their kid badly enough.

"> The people using these drugs recreationally or due to a substance use disorder are not using them in a responsible manner, if they were they wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be dying.

You've got a sampling bias here.  You're regularly seeing only the people in crisis, and not the ones that have been regularly using without issue.  If the only people that consume alcohol that you meet are serious alcoholics in crisis, you'd get the impression that it's a life destroying incredibly dangerous drug.  In reality, most people consume alcohol, and the majority do so responsibly.

The problem is that the issues of unknown potency/contaminants are deadly, and that's completely caused by the street nature.  I hear that you directly see the harm yourself.  If we could snap our fingers and make opiate abuse disappear, of course we'd do it, but we can't.  We live in a world where we can live with opiate use WITH lots of death, or opiate use with few deaths.

You can't turn your life around when you're dead.  For most people, substance abuse is a temporary problem in their lives, but the more misery we create the harder it is for people to get out of it.",90.01,9.99,Is discriminatory,t3_1c8gnmq,7,5
