1,1,"Hello, Saskatoon Redditors,

Back in March I posted about needing help finding resources for Anger Management. Nearly 5 months have passed, and I am proud to say I found and successfully completed 2 programs, both were offered by Catholic Family Services in Prince Albert. 

First, I completed a 6 week course called Calming theStorm, where I learned a lot about my triggers, and learned that anger really is sadness amplified. I learned that I had many unmet needs, and harboured resentment towards my family for it. Even though in reality it was up to me to communicate these needs which I didn't. 

Second, I completed a Gentle Parenting program. I learned that in order to be gentle towards my kids, I had to learn how to be gentle with myself first. That although I was an angry mess, I still was worthy of love and gentleness. I still have my days where I lose my patience with my kids, but I have learned that an apology and some affection can fix these moments. My kids are so loving and forgiving; they just want Mom to be happy! üòä 

I am 4 months sober, which is a long time when youre an alcoholic like me. I relapsed once otherwise I would have been sober longer.

Unfortunately, my partner and I never did get back together. He has moved on with another girlfriend. I'm ok with it. Because if he can't be forgiving and understanding then maybe we aren't meant to be. 
I choose to stay single and focus on healing myself and my kids. I still believe in love and I believe I can be a good partner to someone,but it can wait. Once I finished programming I picked up my kids and I moved to Alberta with them. 

Next, I'll be applying to Nursing school in October. Wish me luck!!! 

I have a long way to go to where I want to be, but I feel so good about myself and the good choices I've made, I know I will get there and my kids will be happy and proud. 

THANK YOU to everyone for being helpful, kind, understanding, and supportive. Also, I am happy to say that my sharing my struggle helped a couple people find the courage to reach out for help as well. I hope you are all doing well as well.",wc63i9,Drugs or Alcohol
1,1,"I am sure most have seen it but the new ""advertising campaign"" is all about how not being vaccinated is no worry for their products..

Most of the comments already point out that this company is beyond stupid but it just seems this company is dedicated to appealing to the grossest and lowest common denominator in all respects.

Most of the comments already point out that this place stole the products of local amazing businesses and tried to pass it off as their own.

Not to mention how they lie about their own products pretending they are official spirits when it is all just cheap grain alcohol with flavorings and dyes.

Then we have the sign trying to advertise and seduce those struggling with alcohol addiction at the AA meeting location advertising the lowest legal price.

This company needs to apologize to the province for always trying to do harm and appealing to the worst and never ever trying to make a decent product and represent the best of this province and city.

1,1,"I'm 19 and usually go there in the evenings to chill and go on my Switch or phone. On that night I heard the security guard, an older woman, start telling these two female teenagers that they need to leave. I couldn't see what was happening from where I sat but they supposedly had alcohol on them. They argued with the security guard that they weren't going to drink in the library and accused them of kicking them out into the cold. One of them said that they needed to get ahold of their parents and would go after that. Next thing you know they're being escorted out and saying it's as if ""they don't expect natves here"" then began pulling books off of the shelves. I tried to ignore this and mind my own business but then I saw one of the girls punch a staff and they either walked out or was pulled out. After this the security guard was being brought back in by two staff members and was crying, she got the worst of it, then everything went went normal after that with books being picked up and stuff. I heard the staff call the police a few times but no one arrived by the time I left at 9:50",1c85oe6,Drugs or Alcohol
1,1,"I'm an immigrant and despite living here for a few years, I'm still confused about tipping and had a weird encounter with a waitress last night who seemed offended by my tip. 

I was told 15% is an average tip on the total before taxes, and alcohol is excluded. So I did this last night and the waitress was annoyed and kept asking if her service was bad. Service was fine, even though I got the wrong side, but whatever it was fine. 

Was this too low? I lived in the US for a year before coming here and I think their servers only make $3 an hour so tipping seemed higher there (18 to 20%) but I've heard servers make normal min wage here? Do we still tip 18%? I'm so confused and don't want to seem like a cheap jerk or going against customs.",17z2k0v,Drugs or Alcohol

1,1,"First off a huge thanks to the STC. They are forced to select a downtown building because that‚Äôs where our homeless population is forced to mingle around. That‚Äôs because our idiotic province put their support services downtown. Rather than going to where they are needed, those social services force people to come to them, which is a barrier to entry. In order to overcome that barrier, the service users are forced to hang around downtown for access. Downtown is supposed to be the working place of a city. The heartbeat of economy that promotes business and retail to generate revenue to support our vulnerable people. It should not be a place to hand out services and attempt to house the homeless‚Ä¶ downtown housing should be for those who want to live close to where they work not be a place they are forced to live to access services. Is downtown really the place where we should be housing our homeless? Downtown should be the heart beat of the cities economy. It should have a thriving business and retail sector where those resources can be generated to help our vulnerable populations. Get social services and other providers to the vulnerable out of downtown. Then we can house people near those services and bring our downtown back to life which will generate more revenue to help more people.

I agree that downtown has lost a lot of its charm while Broadway has maintained it and Riversdale has completely capitalized on it.  The economy isn't what it was 10 years ago and that also has seriously reduced the money being spent downtown and the night life that used to exist.

Prairie harm reduction choose their new location very carefully with the thought of going to the people rather than having their clients try and find them. I‚Äôm 100% for housing our homeless and try each day to learn more about our social issues that seem to be getting much worse country wide. Normalizing mental health, addictions and other social issues is definitely a win. Sadly our downtown is dying and I would like to see it revitalize. Hopefully this helps. I personally would love to see social support services closer to other Health supports like the hospitals and then when we are looking to house people, it‚Äôs into a community and not a warehouse/business district.

For instance, right now there is currently no where for anyone who is actively using to find shelter. Addiction isn‚Äôt a choice and is a struggle for many unsheltered people - so why do we not have beds for this large chunk of the population? PR. That‚Äôs all it is.",t3_rdvmcs,Drugs or Alcohol
1,1,"Stats are true. What we DO with stats is what determines whether someone has problematic views. 

""The majority of homeless people in Saskatoon are Indigenous"" - This is true. I believe it is approximately 85% of our homeless population that identify as Indigenous. That means of the ~500 (as of 2018, I guarantee it is much higher now) homeless people, around 425 of them are Indigenous. 

Now, here's what we could do with these numbers. Option a) Natives are drunk, drug-addicted lazy leeches. They deserve their lot in life, addiction is a moral failing first and foremost, and I don't care about them. Option b) there are intergenerational, societal, economic, and social factors that lead to substance abuse, and if a vast majority of our homeless have a shared background, tailoring our care needs to that group is probably beneficial.

I am so proud of you for taking that first step toward healing and following through, because I know for a fact that it means the world to your kids to see true vulnerability and to watch someone close to them grow and change. I think it‚Äôs the most important lesson you can learn in life and you‚Äôre killing it by walking the walk and showing them how it‚Äôs done!!

I actually like the proposed change, but it does warrant debate as it will fundamentally change the way in which we manage alcohol consumption in public. This is kind of a big deal. In Saskatoon there are lot of public space adjacent to schools, there is a public risk there. Are we going to allow open consumption throughout the downtown?

I don't know, I think Joe Two-Four is going to drink and drive whether he had his tenth drink at a bar, buddy's house, or park. It's a problem no matter what that needs to be addressed by other means. 

The solution to a drunk driving culture isn't prohibition. Don't allow it in parks, they'll drive home from the bar. Don't allow it in bars, they'll drive home from a friend's party. The solution has to target changing the culture of drunk driving being acceptable. Easy, abundant, and affordable alternatives being available would go a long way.

But once inflation hit I stopped going out as much to eat and for drinks. Im pretty mindful of who I tip these days. I understand customer service can be draining but some of the servers I‚Äôve encountered in the past year came across pretty entitled. 

Most memorable one was at Leo‚Äôs last winter. Our server did the bare minimum and was more focused on the other table that was all guys. She forgot ketchup for our fries and never gave a refill on waters or my friends drink. We kept trying to get her attention and just got a new server to help us. We waited an hour to get the bill once all our food was finished with empty drinks. She knew she was toast once she finally came around and we just asked for the bill. My friend flat out skipped the tip and I think I rounded my tip to make it even (douchey? Maybe haha).

I normally tip around 20% with smaller things, like a booster juice smoothie, and 15% for actual meals, depending on the place. I also don‚Äôt factor in taxes.

A mass 1000 calls to labour board in a day from servers would cut that short pretty quickly.  Organising a mass walk out would do the trick. There are many avenues to incite change.

I pay for the food I get, you get paid minimum wage. If I feel like tipping and you've done a good job, I'll leave a tip. If you'd like solidarity in a venture to eliminate mandatory tip out, I'll do what I can to help.

1,1,"Well they mentioned their meal has a side so I don't think it was an app lol.

In the unlikely scenario where that happened though, a $0 tip would be better than a $0.90 in actuality. It's actually less offensive haha. No tip just means hey...they didn't tip maybe. $0.90 tip on a $93 bill would be sending a deliberate message.

Tip culture in general though is just flawed. I used to pump gas for a living. Worked full time hours. Got minimum wage. 99% people don't tip. Nor did I expect one. It wasn't until one day someone gave me a toonie and I was floored (like in a good way. I was excited that I got a tip). Made my day. But still, my expectation was zero tip and when I got one (albeit rarely) it was nice.

My point is though...here are two minimum wage jobs. Somehow in our culture though we've said ""ok this one is worth a 15% tip for this service, and this job isn't"".  It doesn't make a lot of sense. Both people make minimum wage. Both work hard. There were a lot of cold days I'd have to go outside and freeze pumping gas. That was the job though. I got paid my wage. I didn't expect anything more.

Anyways...I'm rambling lol. So I'll stop.

The tips are usually shared between the kitchen staff as well, so their pay will also need to increase. At least now, people like me are sort of subsidizing the lousy tippers. A wage increase means we're all paying that extra 20%. 
Also, the system won't change just because people are refusing to tip. Fair wages happen when people organize and unionize, usually with pressure from the government and/or the public.

2,1,"This stuff is good, but there are a few things I'd add if you want to get past a forever beginner.

1. Having a francophone SO is good but have a group of friends speak French to you or around you is better. More influences, fewer shits given and less politics. But having either is only truly useful when you don't pretend you know what they're saying and you ask a lot of questions. Granted, it can feel awkward at first and you need to get over your ego. Pro tip: don't waste energy explaining why you thought your incorrect phrasing was right. Let it go and focus on remembering the right way.

2. Listening comprehension uses different brain areas than producing language and is the much less intensive of the two processes. You need only use recognition memory to understand language, whereas you need recall memory to use it. Luckily, the more you hear something, the easier it will be to recall. So hack your brain and use the more passive process by watching French tv! The news is a great place to start because they don't speak too quickly and they enunciate. Then, Netflix is amazing for a next step because you can increase the difficulty like so:

- watch something with French audio and put on English subtitles. Keep it to shorter content at first. It's very taxing on your brain when you start out.

- once you've mastered 80% or so understanding what was said, change the subtitles to French. This keeps your brain fully immersed and stops you relying so heavily on your English as a frame of reference.

-remove all subtitles and move on from understanding to mastering the slang and expressions.

Bonne chance, les amis!!

2,1,"What if you have the opposite problem? Raised on Parisian French, somehow have maintained a solid accent when speaking (I've been told this many times, and as flattering as it may be, I'm still not satisfied at my lack of retention for vocabulary), but often translate english words directly into french and realize it occasionally sounds backward. I enjoy practising and speaking, but find I preface by stating 'mon vocabulaire n'est pas tres fort, mais si vous parlez plus lentment, je peux compronde' (was never great at writing french out either). 

Do I just stick with english then, despite being able to speak with an accent but flub up my phrases? I love Montreal. The culture is far more 3 dimensional than the flat culture we have here in the prairies. Will be visiting in May for my 3rd time and looking forward to it.

2,1,"1. Don‚Äôt use online dating unless you‚Äôre hot as fuck. Girls have an abundance of matches and you have no matches, so it‚Äôs unlikely for guys to make it that way unless they have movie star looks and crazy rizz, because the girls can only keep up with so many uninteresting conversations.

2. Clean up your look. A 3/10 guy quickly becomes a 6/10 or 7/10 if they just take care of themselves a bit, no need to hit the gym and go crazy. Nice clothes and a clean haircut go a long way, even if you have a few pounds extra or if you‚Äôre skinny af. Try not to look or smell like a hobo, wash your face in the morning. Facial hair can be good, but it has to be very well taken care of. r/malefashionadvice is great, there are also quite a few good YouTube channel for male styling. It‚Äôs crazy how many guys skip this step and expect women to fall into their laps.

3. Talk to people, not just women. Get social without expecting anything to happen. The more you do that, the better your social skills get. The better your social skills get, the better your flirting skills will get. Learn to listen to others. Old people are GREAT for that, they LOVE to talk to young people. If you don‚Äôt have many friends, well you can use that step to expand your social circle, because women generally won‚Äôt trust someone with no friends. High school is over, the great thing about being an adult in a big city is that like-minded people who will welcome you in their social circle are out there, you just have to find them.

4. Find some hobbies. Don‚Äôt be boring, find something you‚Äôre passionate about that you can share. It can be gardening, painting, running, cooking, chess, sewing, dragon boat, whatever. 

5. Flirt. Talk to girls flirtatiously, use eye contact and occasional light touches when it feels socially appropriate. It‚Äôs extremely hard to do this with a stranger in a setting where it‚Äôs not expected for people to talk to strangers, like at a caf√©, but if your skills are through the roof it‚Äôs possible, though I don‚Äôt advise it. I also wouldn‚Äôt advise coworkers, it can work out great, but if it doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs hell. In whatever setting you think is appropriate, try to flirt. You will stumble a few times, but the more you do it, the better you will get. 

6. Don‚Äôt let yourself be defined by your relationship status. Take steps to make sure you are happy and fulfilled without a relationship, and stop trying too hard to find a relationship. When you finally stop fixating on finding a girl, and focus above everything one your own happiness, suddenly that‚Äôs when you will have the most success with women.

Points 3,4,5 can easily be combined, for example if you like reading, join a book club and talk to people there! Or volunteer at the food bank and talk to the other volunteers and workers there!

If all else fails, there‚Äôs always the nuclear option: find a girl with daddy issues that wants to do mdma, make a baby with her, have a messy break up a few months later. Then you can pick up single girls at the grocery store with your baby.

I remember when the shit hit the fan, everybody was scrambling to get groceries and toilet paper and a full shut down was looming.  It was a late Sunday night, I suspected the city/province was going to shut down on Monday so I went to my office to clean out some equipment so I could set up my work at home.

What I noticed driving through the downtown core was that there were homeless people everywhere.  With everyone gone...they were the only people to see and I could not believe how many I saw..
It was in the hundreds with a huge concentration near de la cathedrale (25-30).  Passing bonaventure was also quite eye opening.

When all the people are gone, the homeless people are basically in plain sight and it was shocking to see how many there were.

2,1,"Lol human empathy, i think that's what I hate MTL the most. People telling others to have empathy for junkies and homeless. I grew up in a third world country and life isn't easy there and i don't see junkies running amok. I will never have empathy for these people.

I have not seen all the dodgiest areas of Canada and North America. What I have seen is probably enough for me to know Montreal is a shit hole that people like to love it and hate on other Canadian cities and US cities. In fact I suspect there's a small d syndrome here where people in MTL keep saying they are best in Canada and I don't see other cities talking about MTL at all. Just my observation. 

From an outsiders POV, I think other cities people like to shit on have their own interesting things to like that might not suit those who love Montreal. 
 
I wouldn't claim to be super well traveled but I do travel and see things. I work in an industry with people who come from many corners of the world. Overall from what I have gathered, not everyone love this dump. Just you guys. Montreal is nothing spectacular, more of a sleepy town with people who think its best in the world. It's not that cheap, dirty af, a bunch of lazy people living here and think it's the funniest place. 

But fine have a good life guys and believe what you want to believe. 

I can't wait to get out of this piece of shit city.",t3_11emcht,Drugs or Alcohol
2,1,"Not trying to change anyone's mind. Just saying I think MTL is a piece of shit city and don't understand why people think it's some paradise sort of place. 

Also I think those metrics are bs. There are a lot of things that look good on paper but doesn't really work.

 yes it has free healthcare which doesn't work and take months or you can pay hundreds for it. 

Yes it has decent public transport that only services like a core part of the city that isn't that big of an area. The train stations are dirty af full of junkies. It flooded when it rained a bit more last year. That's not some world class transport. 

Yes the housing is cheap compared to other cities but it's old and run down. 
The food sucks, it's fast food everywhere and not cheap with it's price + Quebec tax + tips and the service is terrible. 

The road has holes everywhere and puddles. The people litter everywhere. This city doesn't even have a functioning bin system where people just dump their trash on the street on trash day. 

Tax is high and the city is fairly unfriendly to immigrants. 

So many things and people still think it's the best place in the world.

I think the type of people who think MTL is awesome are people who have low income, don't care to advance on the career ladder and live a lazy life. People who don't value quality of things but more an easy going way of life. They think they value creativity and an alternative lifestyle over money. That's why things don't work well in this city. It's cultural.",t3_11emcht,Drugs or Alcohol
2,1,"While your thoughts on the matter tend to lean towards ‚Äúharsh‚Äù, you are absolutely correct when you say they will not accept the kind of help intended to get them off of drugs - they simply do not want to do that.

The help they need will likely have to be imposed on them. But then you get a whole bunch of bleeding hearts complaining about civil rights abuse. Then, if you turn around and allow them to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù when and how they seek help, they just won‚Äôt - that‚Äôs what addiction does to you.

Those in this thread calling HotNewspaper out are not likely to have experienced the depths of addiction‚Ä¶it turns you in to something completely different. The logic and morals and social conventions that bind most of our societies and cultures together disappear, and human dignity is not a priority. You cannot make a decision to get help for your addiction at this point - even if you do, this is an exception and not the rule.

Really, the answer to the original question ‚Äúwhat can we do‚Äù is multi faceted‚Ä¶for most people, the question is ‚Äúwhat should we *not* be doing?‚Äù. 

Well‚Ä¶do not give them a single penny from your wallet. More broadly, do not give them a single opportunity to perpetuate their illness. If you feel badly for them, there are a few amazing organizations in Montreal that help distribute food, medicine/medical services, and shelter - they will be happy to take your donation and ensure that it goes somewhere other than whatever fuels someone‚Äôs addiction.

It‚Äôs important that people have empathy, but it‚Äôs also important that people know their limits and have boundaries on what is acceptable. Anyone with a family member struggling with addiction knows that people, even ones who you love, will manipulate you in order to get themselves through the day. It‚Äôs also important to know that not everyone can go out and save the world. So by *not* giving them (addicts) the resources they need to perpetuate their lifestyle, by *not* taking action in certain situations, you‚Äôll be helping in small ways that can eventually make a big difference.

Instead, *do* support the people and organizations that specialize in helping those struggling with addiction. They will know what to do and how to help in almost any situation. 

Finally, humanize people wherever possible‚Ä¶politely decline to give change, but say hello and give a smile. Exchange greetings, engage in small talk - a lot of addicts don‚Äôt see a reason to get better because they feel society and people have failed them - give them a reason to want to get back to a normal life, show that there are good people out there. You may never see the effects of something as trivial as small talk or a simple smile, but giving someone human respect can have a cascading effect of positivity. 

It can be frustrating and sad and disgusting and enraging to see the level of harm people can have on themselves and on the community, but they aren‚Äôt themselves anymore. It‚Äôs hard for healthy people to fathom how badly addiction cripples the mind.

Unfortunately, the solutions that work don‚Äôt seem to fit with the narrow world views of bleeding hearts or hard-asses, so the discussion usually ends with the two camps slinging insults at each other for either being too naive or too harsh.",t3_11emcht,Drugs or Alcohol

2,1,"It‚Äôs usually junkie-type crowds that make the creative stuff lol if that‚Äôs what you wanna see, you might have to hang around them. Historically (with the exception of The Renaissance), great art or artistry emerged out of poverty, and poverty has the strongest association to crime, which often is adjacent to druggies.



-Basquiat from NY was a Heroin addict, and he is the most celebrated recent artist in history. His painting called ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù was sold for $110million+ 6 years ago, making it one of the most expensive paintings ever sold. Madonna also had sex with him back when he was alive (He died at 27 years of age‚Ä¶ of a Heroin overdose).


-Rap emerged out of Crack-epidemic neighborhoods in NY


-House music emerged out of the 70s in the middle of the heroin crisis in Chicago


-Adjacently, techno music was the music coming out 70s Detroit epidemic


-The Weeknd was a homeless guy in Toronto

The artsy crowd in MTL is most visible in June, begins around Grand-Prix weekend, but mainly due to the Mural Festival which blocks off St-Laurent street from cars for a month.


The focus is on up and coming street artists whom usually paint their arts illegally, to come and paint their works legally on consented walls for murals on buildings on St Laurent.


However, pretty much every artist in multiple fields end up gathering over there and doing their own thing.


I know of a former-homeless dude who used to eat out the garbage, but was already a pretty well known Montreal painter. That was 14 years ago. Now he tours the world, making murals in multiple countries.



Grimes (Elon Musk‚Äôs latest baby-mother and ex-gf) was a junkie who used to frequent the warehouse parties in Plateau close to Parc Avenue. She and her friends used to host illegal parties at an abandoned warehouse for 3 years until cops busted it back in the early 2010s.


I never got in the indie rock crowd but that niche also exists, Arcade Fire and Half Moon Run are the two biggest to come out of that scene.



The biggest rapper from MTL is Enima, who left to go to Europe because police in Qu√©bec want him arrested for being a pimp and running a prostitution ring (ALLEGEDLY). While in Europe, he‚Äôs ended up signing to one of France‚Äôs biggest record labels, and still releases music. VT is from the same neighborhood as Enima (Saint-Leonard), and he‚Äôs been on the run from cops for over a year now (allegedly involved in a lot of shootings). So if you want to witness that type of artistry, you should hang out in St-Michel/St Leonard/Montreal North/Rivieres Des Prairies, but you might accidentally get shot.


If it‚Äôs real art you wanna see, it‚Äôs some very homeless/junky/hipster/crime-friendly crowds you‚Äôre going to have to be around. Personally, I been around those crowds a lot when I was younger, but I don‚Äôt care for arts anymore. I experienced my fair share of that crowd and grew out of it. They‚Äôre really not pleasant people to be around. A lot of backstabbing, a lot of drama. Ppl who grew out of it have abandoned that scene (which has multiple sub-scenes) and have either become white collar workers with families, fully-removed from going out, Or, switched scenes to hanging in the Old-Port and being around bougie rich snobs. Unfortunately, my main group of people have become the latter.



The artsy crowds are all plagued with too much BS, but there‚Äôs always rare gems that come out of them.",t3_11emcht,Drugs or Alcohol

I'm in my 30s, been sober for 4 years, and it is the best thing that's ever happened to me. 

My brain was like a box of tangled Christmas lights. I was anxious and hopeless and depressed, on a roller coaster making terrible decisions again and again. Terrified of the future but couldnt bear being in the present. I was lucky enough to fuck up real bad with my drinking which landed me in rehab and eventually led me to AA. For me, AA was the thing that saved me. I've learned to live in a way where Im happier and more comfortable with life than I was even before I discovered drinking.  I thought I was being given a life sentence (no little girl dreams of being in AA and no one who needs alcohol actually wants to have to stop -- i truly NEVER wanted to be sober) but holy shit it's actually given me so much more than was ever taken away and my experience of life is so much better than I thought was possible? I still have problems, obviously, but they hit different and they don't kill me the way they used to. 

And I have so many friends (many of them in their mid 30s) who just get it - because we've all been there! We can laugh at how batshit insane we are and it helps. 

I know AA isn't everybody's path (I think a lot of people get really hung up on the ""God"" aspect which is often misunderstood), but it definitely saved my life. 

Also, I have a lot of mental health issues, and therapy and meds is definitely part of it for me (AA is not a replacement for legit psychological/psychiatric treatment) but all of that is easier without the drinking!

Personally, now that I quit drinking and weed too, I don't like living downtown anymore. Sobriety has changed the way I see people and the environment I'm living in.

Breathalyzers can detect alcohol on the breath for up to 24 hours !! Depending on the amount of alcohol consumed. It drops at 0.015 per hour. So if you're at 0.08 it would take roughly 5.3h to be at 0. Zero tolerance is a bit extreme.

It would however, take only 1.3h to go from 0.08 to 0.05. A drop to 0.05 to follow other provinces is not a bad idea and should at the very least be considered. 

We have zero tolerance for new drivers, for the 2 years probationary license, and all those under 22 years old. Zero tolerance also applies to bus drivers and taxis. We have 0.05 for heavy vehicles.

Here's my take on what they are doing:

The guy is standing in an alleyway that overlooks the wide open area of the market with heaters beside the restaurants and little stalls selling hot wine / drinks etc. 

The observer waits for people to order two cups of something because people will have a hard time getting their wallet back into their coat or bag. They set the mark here. 

When/If the person walks down the alleyway with a drink in hand, the guy stops them with ""No alcohol allowed"" and the partner bumps into them and takes the wallet.

‚ÄúAh, Scarborough, the land of contradictions! Picture a place where the sun occasionally peeks through the clouds, only to realize it's lost and promptly disappears again. It's a neighborhood in Toronto that seems to have a love-hate relationship with itself.

Let's start with the roads. You know you've entered Scarborough when you encounter a pothole large enough to swallow a small car. It's like a never-ending obstacle course for drivers who are constantly testing their shock absorbers and praying for divine intervention. If you manage to survive the roads, you'll be rewarded with a glimpse of Scarborough's famous traffic jams, where the term ""rush hour"" is laughably optimistic.

But hey, Scarborough isn't all about the roads. It's also home to an impressive collection of strip malls. You can find everything your heart desires in these charming retail establishments: discount stores, dollar stores, and more discount stores! It's like a never-ending quest for the best deal, where the prices are low, and the fluorescent lighting is soul-sucking.

Now, let's talk about the weather. Scarborough likes to keep you on your toes. One minute, you're sweating like a marathon runner in a sauna, and the next, you're shivering like a popsicle in the Arctic. The weather forecast is basically a random number generator, so be prepared for four seasons in a day. Pack an umbrella, a parka, sunscreen, and flip-flops‚Äîall at the same time.

Scarborough is also known for its diverse population, and with diversity comes a melting pot of cuisines. You can take a culinary trip around the world without leaving the neighborhood. From mom-and-pop shops serving mouthwatering roti to hidden gems dishing out delicious Hakka noodles, your taste buds will thank you for the adventure.

And let's not forget Scarborough's vibrant wildlife. Squirrels reign supreme, acting like tiny acrobats on a quest for world domination. They'll steal your snacks, terrorize your garbage bins, and boldly scurry across the road just when you thought it was safe to drive.

All joking aside, Scarborough may have its quirks, but it's a place with a sense of community, where people look out for each other and come together in times of need. It's a neighborhood that embraces its flaws, laughs at itself, and keeps going with a unique charm that's hard to resist.‚Äù

3.5 Evaluation

The evaluation will assess the impact of the pilot for park users and the neighbouringcommunity in terms of park use and experience; public safety; and financial costs
aligned with the five guiding principles. Based on learnings from other municipalities, theevaluation will use multiple data collection methods and sources, including:

ÔÇ∑ An online public survey that will be open for the duration of the pilot. The survey will
be the main method for collecting feedback from park users and adjacentneighbours and businesses on their experience of the pilot. Key areas to besurveyed include: visitor experience and satisfaction; experience of safety; parkcleanliness; how people travelled to the parks; and communication about the pilot.The survey will be featured on the project webpage and pilot park signage. A socialmedia approach will be used to disseminate information about the survey and pilot.

ÔÇ∑ Review of various data sources to inform the evaluation including: 311 data (e.g.complaints related to park conduct and alcohol consumption, overflowing bins),
health administrative records (e.g. city-wide number of emergency visits related toalcohol, and calls to 911 (e.g. police response to disturbances in the pilot parks).

ÔÇ∑ The evaluation will also use field observations from staff where possible.

ÔÇ∑ Financial data will be used to understand the cost impacts of the pilot.Results of the evaluation will be reported to City Council in Q1 2024 and support
evidence-based decision-making about a longer-term approach to alcohol in Toronto

The six-lane section east of the Humber River was built in segments from 1955 until 1964 by the Metropolitan Toronto government with provincial highway funds. The ten-lane section west of the Humber was formerly part of the QEW. The Gardiner Expressway is wholly owned and operated by the City of Toronto.

By 1952, the lake shore highway plan cost had escalated to an estimated $30 million. Toronto's Mayor Allan A. Lamport objected to the cost being borne solely by the City of Toronto. Lamport suggested that the road could be built either as a toll road or built by private interests. A toll road was opposed by the Ontario Deputy Minister of Highways J. D. Millar, who suggested that ""cars would be waiting for miles"" to pay a three-cent tax. Millar stated that ""the Ontario driver was taxed and taxed heavily and expected his roads will be paid for.""

In the late 1980s, Metro Toronto proposed to widen the Gardiner to eight lanes from Strachan Avenue to the Humber, and extend Front Street from Bathurst Street west to connect with the highway. The widening proposal was never implemented as it depended on provincial funding which never materialized.

On April 1, 1997 the stretch of the Queen Elizabeth Way between Highway 427 and the Humber River was downloaded from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario to Metropolitan Toronto and was redesignated as part of the Gardiner.",t3_177s1fw,Drugs or Alcohol

I see it more from our southern neighbours then here but a lot of people think something is a right that is merely a privilege.

Does it really matter where a person is drinking, so long as they are **under the limit**?

Whats the difference if I go inside a restaurant and have a beer instead, the end result is the same.

And a passenger isnt behind the wheel at all.  He should be free to do whatever he wants, hes zero danger to the public.

The states where this is legal recognize that its not where the drinking is happening that is important, its what the BAC of the driver is that matters.

I had a friend sell moonshine from his room on a campus which was highly restrictive about alcohol. He covered his tuition(including residence) before the end of October, and was just raking it in after that. He sold a small U-Haul trailer-full every couple of weeks. To put this in perspective, it was over 1000 jars per trailer and he sold them for about $20 per. His cost (from family was about $5). Thus he cleared about $15k per trailer.

The only crappy part was he had to do his entire 6 years of his 2 degrees in the crappiest residence (best location for sales). His main complaint was all the drunken partying.

Looking at the experiences I've been told about dry oil field work camps is if you don't provide alcohol, someone will, and many will provide drugs. The braniacs running them then started testing for these drugs which meant people started taking nightmare drugs for which there were no tests. But as one friend who worked in safety told me about just letting booze in to try to reduce drug and weird drug use, ""Never going to happen.

There are next to no beers from countries known for brewing excellence, such as Belgium, U.K and Germany. There was a time that new beers were brought in on a weekly basis, and there was a much better selection of regular listings too.

It's clear to see what they are doing, which is putting all their eggs into the local craft beer basket, in order to save money. The local brewers deliver the beer for free and the NLC has to do little or no work. One of the problems is that local beer is available literally everywhere, so the NLC is just duplicating availability, but with less locations and worse hours of operation. So, because of this, we now get little variety from anywhere else anymore. We only have about twenty local craft breweries right now, and some of them are not very active, some are clearly local event spaces only, and some just aren't that good.

People have this notion that a VLT machine will get ‚Äúheavy‚Äù after not paying out for a while. The more money people pump into the machines, the more likely they think they are to win. This just isn‚Äôt how these machines work, at all. It‚Äôs a basic misunderstanding of statistics‚Ä¶if you flip a coin 10 times and it‚Äôs heads every time, what are the chances that the next flip will be tails?

I have some strong views on gambling.

As a libertarian (you should be free to do what you like as long as no one is forcefully harmed by your actions) I do not gamble, but don't think it is my business to restrict others from their choices.

I see gambling as ""voluntary taxation"", and I don't think it is a wise use of resources.

Does someone want to take $100 and spend it on a fancy meal as entertainment?  Great, you do you.  Does someone else want to spend $100 at the casino for entertainment?  Fine, be free.

One thing that ""grinds my gears"" is when my volunteer work with the food bank has me working hard to help others afford groceries, and then I see them blow $100 on ALC products.  They are free to spend their money as they wish, but this one makes me a little annoyed.

Same thing with welfare recipients who complain their check is not enough (I agree) but then spend money foolishly on ALC products or weed or alcohol.  Again, they are free to spend their money as they wish, but my sympathy for their financial woes quickly disappears.

Here are some things I have learned.

* People gamble because they like the feeling (reward) they get as they are playing.  They are not addicted to winning, but to the thrill of gambling.

* People sometimes give me tickets as a gift (Christmas, birthday) and I thank them for their kindness.  That said, I wish they kept their money.

* If I could vote for legislation that people on welfare were not allowed to use that money for ALC products, weed or alcohol, I would, **even though it goes against my basic libertarian philosophy.**  (Stop using my tax $$ for ALC products.)",t3_17ags3m,Drugs or Alcohol

Of course every slot machine and every game doesn‚Äôt have the same core math model or else all the manufacturers would be suing each other for intellectual property infringement. Therefore it is impossible to say all slot machines work in a specific way.

I can use Konami Quick Strike with extended bet features as an example where there is an accumulated bonus with no backend overflow, meaning that if the low end bonus gets to it‚Äôs displayed maximum it will just dump out on the next spin. But it is very important to understand that same information does not hold true for other games. Many games have hidden overflow pots and will gladly just keep taking all your money.

This why I some players have the false perception games get heavy and then payout. It‚Äôs because a few games out there actually do, but it is important to stress the vast majority of games don‚Äôt work that way. 

Most individual games in Canada are set to around 90% RTP. It‚Äôs a calculated average payout based on 2 million spins which is where BMM and GLI come into to the picture. They are software test facilities for the entire global gaming market with offices right here in town.

If a game has a WAN or LAN progressive the high end jackpot accounts for about 2% to 5% of the machines lifetime payout. Adding a progressive jackpot is a sneaky way for companies to lower the base payout without advertising it.

If a site offers game ‚Äòsuch and such‚Äô which players love and that site re-introduce‚Äôs the same game with a linked progressive and the RTP hasn‚Äôt changed it means the base payout dropped around 3%

The way that I explain it to my friends (which are players) is to think of the 93% RTP as thought you‚Äôre practically guaranteed to lose a minimum of 7%",t3_17ags3m,Drugs or Alcohol

6,1,"I'm an Indian who moved to Moncton almost a coupla years ago. My pals tell me I'm quite blunt and call a spade, a spade. Most Canadians I've been with seem to appreciate it so here goes:

1. I've lived in Africa and briefly in Europe before deciding to immigrate here so I've been around people with diverse food choices. Despite knowing the fact that Beef is a North American staple, I WAS a bit startled at the amount being consumed everywhere but that was just curiosity. It's certainly not my place to comment upon/disparage other food choices. Beef is just something people consume and enjoy just as how I enjoy my 'Sambar Vada'. I have no 'beef' with that. I'm a vegetarian for both moral and religious reasons so no interest in 'trying' any kinds of meat.
2. Same as Answer 1. I've tasted Alcohol recently and enjoy a sampling of it every now and then. I really enjoy vising 'Alcool' and taking a gander at all the colourful bottles being displayed when I have some time to burn. I'm an ABSOLUTE novice (I've never tasted Alcohol before coming to NB) so not much to report there except for the fact that the one drink I enjoy is a splash of Jack Daniels with lotsa Coke.
3. I researched quite a bit about the Canadian way of life before moving here so this wasn't a surprise. I used to get flustered back home in India with all the queue jumpin' so this was welcome. However, I'm quite an impatient guy so it's hard for me to conceal a grunt and a frown when I see someone dawdling in front of me so I turn to my spouse to grumble and she invariably grins.
4. Good question. Contrary to popular stereotypes, Canadians can be quite rude. Sometimes, I snap back by reflex but that's just how the cookie crumbles. I'm not really diffident about how I move with folks nor do I particularly care about how I'm perceived. I treat everyone with equal warmth and courtesy and that's been reciprocated. Now that I think about it,  I live in my own bubble and have my own life plans and goals so I haven't really thought much about North American culture to be honest. I did my homework and research and blended in pretty quickly.
5. One of the primary reasons I moved to Moncton was to enjoy driving around and taking in the sights. I really enjoy road trips. I've visited PEI and Nova Scotia as well. So many that I've lost count. We had a whale of a time visiting Halifax, Cabot Trail, Charlottetown, Shediac, Miramichi, Hopewell Rocks, Amherst, Peggy's Cove....the works. The 'Skyline Walk' was a particular highlight. I'd just rev up my car, select a favourite 'Iron Maiden' number on my Playlist and ramp up the volume.",t3_yoo679,Drugs or Alcohol

7,1,"This is why some people require sobriety and cannot ""just have a few drinks"". When someone has a drug addiction / or substance use disorder, it affects the brain. All humans have a neurochemical pathway for dopamine which causes pleasure, and this is also connected to survival. Things that release dopamine help us to survive, such as drinking water, eating food, or having sex. Generally, humans walk around with dopamine levels of 0 or 2 - for example, if you're feeling thirsty and you have a glass of water your dopamine will rise, or something more extreme like riding a roller coaster causes rises of dopamine in a normal range. However, alcohol and drugs also release dopamine and cause pleasure, but do it at a higher rate than the basic life necessities of survival. It is not natural levels - Alcohol can bring levels to as high as 8 and crack cocaine to 12. When we abuse a substance our dopaminergic pathways shut down because it is getting too much dopamine, and as such one starts to rely on the substance to experience pleasure. At this point, the brain thinks the substance is essential for survival. If you try to stop using, it can feel like being told you can't have water when you're thirsty. Most importantly, if someone is sober and dependency has occurred historically, reintroducing the substance into the body will instantly shut down the dopaminergic system because it remembers. It then prevents its own natural release.  So, ""just a couple of drinks"" can shut down the dopamine factory and cause a spiral of unpleasant physical and mental health conditions if not treated appropriately.

7,1,"EMS have recently implemented a new mental health triage protocol, broadening the criteria for transporting patients to low acuity sites like SOGH, CCG, VGH and now the CRC (which is great) as well. The goal is to alleviate pressures on our ER‚Äôs.

This includes patients with minor/moderate agitation, hallucinations, bizarre behaviour, meth use, anxiety etc.

I don‚Äôt necessarily think this is a bad decision, but I do agree that security at these sites have not been adequately adjusted to accommodate these patients. The security at HSC vs the security at any other facility, including the other ER‚Äôs is like night and day. They‚Äôre trained to intervene and don‚Äôt hesitate. 

Security either needs to be expanded everywhere or EMS needs to scale back what‚Äôs being brought to UC. It can be difficult for EMS to decide which site is appropriate because while the patient is acting normally with EMS, things can quickly change 1 hour later at a hospital, especially when meth and paranoia is involved. I do also believe that patients act a little more respectfully and reserved towards paramedics than they do to hospital staff. Frequent flyers know if they‚Äôre aggressive or violent towards EMS, they‚Äôll end up sedated or tied down to the stretcher so they‚Äôll behave. People in a meth psychosis don‚Äôt know up from down, they‚Äôll almost certainly end up at HSC. 
My point is that what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to one health care worker is not the normal to the next, so some might slip through the cracks. 

You should not fear going to work though, and your concerns need to be brought up to management. NO ONE deserves to be assaulted at work. EMS and hospital management need to figure something out. I feel like the CRC needs their funding expanded like 50x to accommodate all the mental health and substance use patients. Our hospitals shouldn‚Äôt be a catch all for these patients, no one‚Äôs mental health and addictions are being resolved at UC‚Äôs or ER‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs a never ending game of catch and release.

Even if you think that private companies will charge higher prices for worse service when selling alcohol, that isn't a reason to not even allow private companies to compete with the public option.  
  
I'm not so up on power generation in Ontario but from what I read it sounds like that has a lot to do with their government signing really bad deals with private companies where they projected a lot higher demand than there ended up being?

I feel that energy policy is significantly more complex and requires more expertise though than whether stores should be allowed to sell wine. We have private stores for everything else: shoes, shirts, tools, flowers, ... and even other controlled substances (tobacco, beer stores, cannabis shops, gun shops) so there's not really any argument that makes sense why some types of alcohol specifically should be singled out to only be sold by the government.

Beyond that, remember the crown Royal northern harvest craze? Well Alberta liquor stores, being private and all, were charging upwards of $70 a bottle while Manitoba maintained MSRP. This also happens with Alberta Premium Cask Strength releases.

A lot of folks seem to think products just magically materialize without there being transportation in between.

It‚Äôs $31.50 for a 15 pack of Bud in Ontario (that‚Äôs with taxes included). $33.99 at Willow Park in Alberta ($35.69 after tax) and‚Ä¶. $28.79 ($32.24 after tax) in Manitoba.

My dad has been working there for 30 years and he might get kicked out in the next few years. On top of that, racism in those countries is unmatched in any first world nations, imo.

The Vancouver Green Party has voted against many housing projects for years.

1. I did make a decision to move (with my partner) for what was 100% financial reasons. My whole family is here.

That first winter was a wake up call but seeing so many others handle the extreme cold helped a lot. We are now back here and I feel it was worth it but also really had to fight to get back here. Tbh I was scared we‚Äôd end up staying there for life! 

2. Empathy for immigrants. The reality is, many millions of people around the world move away from their entire countries and cultures for opportunity or to escape danger. My own move simply to a different Canadian city made me really think about how courageous many people are. I‚Äôm sure many didn‚Äôt want to leave everything they knew but they did.

They should have tons of equity, and you can pay back the bank for the construction loan instead of throwing money to landlords. They already own the land, which is the most expensive part. Building a new building on that existing land that can serve all of your needs would be disruptive but much cheaper than trying to buy your own property somewhere where you have to also buy the land.

This is my family's plan for our children if they cannot afford to move out once they are grown in a dozen+ years, turn the house into a multiplex. It's a way of sharing the housing security we've been able to secure without them having to wait for us to die first. On our end we get to spend more time with them, support as we age, and potentially grandkids next door.",t3_1allpt0,Drugs or Alcohol
8,1,"""Just move"" is a crappy response, but I think there's a few things going on. The expectation of home ownership, just because our parents did it, is kind of taking it for granted. Vancouver wasn't an internationally known city with a high standard of living 50 years ago. Cost of living has also gone up everywhere in North America, having just one bread winner in the family isn't possible anymore anywhere.

It's just supply and demand. There's limited land and tons of people want to live here. This problem isn't unique to Vancouver; people in New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong etc. have gotten used to the expectation of renting for life. Vancouver's rental market is a huge problem for sure. But a single person on a median income should be able to afford to rent a $2000 basement in Langley, or families with two incomes a $3000 suite.

Maybe it's our expectations. We expect to ""enjoy life"" and have some disposable income to do various things. Many expect to be able to afford pets, or have one room for each child, and multiple bathrooms in their houses. Many of our parent's or grandparent's generation gave up everything to move to a better place. Multiple people sharing a small space, never going on vacation, etc. My parents were lucky enough to save and buy a house on below minimum wage, which is impossible today. But I also remember eating out was a huge and rare luxury, sushi was like mind blowing when it happened. Even as a tiny kid I knew the exact price of a small fry and hamburger at McDonald's (cause cheeseburgers cost like $0.10 more which was too much). Christmas was one small gift, if at all. But we were still happy and got by. 

Nowadays I have coworkers complaining about paying bills, but they're constantly snacking on expensive snacks and baked goods, going on lunch together, buying whatever groceries they feel like cooking at the supermarket (instead of whatever is in season/on sale at the discount grocer), etc. I'm not saying we should all live without enjoying life, but there's quite a huge gap between what today's generation feels they deserve to live a comfortable life, versus the minimum needed to get by with a roof over your head and 3 meals.",t3_1allpt0,Drugs or Alcohol
8,1,"Some of people say it as they went thru that and worked great.

Like, I moved as it was shit back home and wanted to see Canada. Wife moved as job offer was better for her then job offers in London.

We will stay couple more years, as it's great money and buy one more house in UK and go back. 

So just move is legitimate thing that we do recommend to do if you want to get yourself better in life. Lot of people from back home moved, most people we know in our circle moved to Canada and got better life. So if it's not working yes you move. Or you get peace that it is what it is and you're happy with life

You're hardly scraping minimum wage at that rate. You'd probably be better off just buying cheap beer, or cheap booze when it's on sale and leaning to make cocktails.

Our transit system is ""pretty great"" only for a small part of Vancouver. For the rest of the Lower Mainland, driving is much faster than transit by far. When I was going to UBC, each way took me \~1 hour to drive vs. 1.5-2 hours of transit each way. I was coming from near Lougheed Mall.

You're definitely right about the first sentence, but without distilling, it's very difficult to make alcohol that's dangerous. You can make some terrible tasting swill that gives you awful hangovers, but there is just not enough of the ""bad"" alcohols in homebrew beer/wine/non-distilled hooch to actually be dangerous.

I'm not in medicine but I do remember reading that they already have this kind of priority-making for other medical procedures. Like liver transplants ‚Äî preference is given to someone who will be more likely to have a successful transplant, meaning that if two people needed a liver transplant and one of them was a heavy alcoholic with no signs of stopping, the non-alcoholic would be first in line. 

Isn't it the same with antivaxxers? Their actions (not getting a shot when it's been free for ages AND when they can get fucking paid to get one) show that they are not likely to put their health first. 

you know why so many people are saying antivaxxers don't deserve care? Because their own loved ones, people who did the right thing and got vaccinated, are in positions where they can't access the care they need because someone was too fuckin lazy to get a shot. Someone yesterday said their grandparent had a brain tumour removal delayed indefinitely because of the ICU shenanigans. If someone with a brain tumour took up an ICU bed, nobody will get mad at them because you can't really do anything about it.

Also ‚Äî check out the HermanCainAward subreddit. The antivaxxers dying in hospitals are for the most part absolute dickheads. They brag about flaunting restrictions. They make fun of people who follow them. They are told again and again that getting a shot protects them and can save them and their loved ones from a painful fate, but they're too stupid and/or arrogant to listen.

Actually, it does bother me that it's affecting other people. I know one person who's surgery was delayed because the hospitals are stretched thin. That just feels so fucked up to me. I'm not sure what to do or think about it anymore. I wish we didn't have to deal with it anymore.

I myself have both shots but I have argued and defended for people who don't want to get the shot, and perhaps as someone in the field you can clarify my points.

Firstly, it's not that fatal, in Canada for example I believe the median age of covid deaths is 84 while the average life expectancy is 82, implying its mainly lethal to the elderly, so if the average adult isn't keen on getting the shot, I don't blame them.

Secondly, we really do not have info, as far as I know, other vaccines such as polio/tetanus etc have had years, if not a decade of testing for side effects and long term effects before they became as wide spread, it's simply not possible to guarantee the covid vaccine is fully safe. Furthermore, the a Johnson vaccine was declared safe, millions of people took it and now, certain countries have even banned it, who knows if the AZ one gets banned in 2 months or something? The testing simply isn't there on account of the time period these were made in. Not saying it can be as bad as thalidomide, but we don't know yet.",t3_pq3gct,Drugs or Alcohol

You make a very good point relating these antivaxers  to those who harm themselves in other ways. I agree with some of the comments that often times things like addictions may seem like self inflicted issues when they are vastly more complex, and I know you understand that too.  But people need to also realize that antivaxers may seem now like people making the wrong choice on their own; but just like the addict people are a product of many things.

I also am currently fighting a terrible gambling addiction that has absolutely fucked me up. So I definitely empathize with the addiction side of things. 
Also I gained over 30 pounds since 2020 (depression, quitting smoking, not being as active) so I get that too. 

I guess what I want to say is your not alone. And there are so many of us who struggle too. 

Please use Alberta Health Services to get talking to a therapist for free. There is a wait line, but definitely get in the line!! It might take time, but time will pass whether you are in the line or not. 

Drinking is a depressant. I can‚Äôt drink anymore as it causes me horrible horrible anxiety. I drink maybe once every few months and it takes me legit weeks to recover from it. I know how horribly hard it is to stop, but could you try taking a break from the alcohol for a while? Or limiting yourself to only one day a week? It will help your brain and soul start healing so much quicker if you‚Äôre not consuming alcohol. do you smoke weed? Maybe you could just do that? Indica strains are better (in my opinion) if you have anxiety. 

For the weight gain, the biggest thing I can recommend is taking walks. I know some days it literally seems impossible and I struggle with it too, but if you can even go for a 10 minute walk, it will help with both weight and depression. Also, could you get a part time job as a waitress? Not only does it help with money, but the constant walking helps get steps in too!

There are plenty of free services that WANT to help you and treat this very seriously. The crisis line is a good start and you can even text them if you don't want to talk. You are not alone!

Sometimes, it can be very hard to see past the issues that put you in this depressive state, so try to develop a plan with goals to get you out of it. Mapping out a plan of recovery in itself can hopefully help lift you enough to actually put it into action. 

People love you and care about you, and don't want to see you in this depressive state. Reaching out to family and/or friends just to chat is also a good way to boost your morale. Call that friend/family member you haven't talked to in years, it may help stop you from grabbing the bottle.

Please don't think the below suggestions are all things you need to do now. Small changes in life add up to big things. 

1. Give yourself a hug and a pat on the back. You seem to have tried a lot of avenues to get help and that deserves recognition and celebration. It's hard to research these things and even harder to reach out and try to implement them. 

2. Please consider a recovery program like AA. As you probably know, alcohol is a depressant and will not help your mental health, even if it feels good in the moment.

3. Please speak to your doctor. I'm sure you know there are many different depression meds on the market. It takes time and effort to test them out to find the right med/dosage combination for you because it often takes several weeks for them to become effective. Sometimes the change is subtle and dosage needs to go up, sometimes the side effects are too bad to continue. 

4. Ask your doctor about CBT and possibly getting into a program if you haven't already. It helps a lot of people and is an avenue to explore /consider.

The distress line and even the cops are always willing to help the best they can if it gets that far.

Treating either of them traditionally tends not to have any real effect, but treating the ADHD can clear up the anxiety and the depression without additional treatments.

ADHD also comes with addiction struggles, as the condition effectively is a dopamine deficiency, and your actions are motivated by a need to get dopamine NOW, regardless of how that happens, and drugs and alcohol can provide that effect.

It's an unfortunate reality that it's even easier for a doctor to miss ADHD in adults, as we still kind of think of ADHD as something that only impacts kids, but it really does impact adults.

It's also a really unfortunate reality that doctors often miss ADHD in women too, as it doesn't usually present with the physical hyperactivity, and they are imagining ADHD as a 12 year old boy bouncing off walls, but in women it tends to manifest as addictive tendencies, disinterest in any activity, and social anxiety, pretty much textbook what you described",t3_xfrs6z,Drugs or Alcohol

9,1,"I‚Äôm not from Calgary, but this post showed up on my popular page so I‚Äôll throw in my two cents 

As many others are saying, the drinking doesn‚Äôt help the depression. It actually fuels it, like most other drugs/substances 

I can actually confirm this from experience, as I was an addict for nearly half my life. I couldn‚Äôt face what my reality was so I‚Äôd drink until everything was fun again, then a bunch of coke so I could drink even more. I‚Äôm nearly five years sober now, but during that 14 year period I died nine times from overdosing/alcohol poisoning 


My first step was taking advantage of the free resources in my city (Winnipeg), despite having a negative stigma towards them. I found free peer support counselling through a local mental health clinic, and ended up doing a bunch of volunteer work for them that was super fulfilling 

Ultimately what got me out of my funk was exploring my mind, trying to see why I was thinking the way I was and connecting the dots to realize, ‚Äúthis has already happened, I can‚Äôt change it. I need to accept this and move on.‚Äù

Granted, that‚Äôs way easier said than done, and takes a lot of effort and determination. But a baby step is still a step forward, it‚Äôs still progress no matter how far you‚Äôre advancing

He is in his 70's and is a very humble and down to earth man. He has a beautiful property an hour or so from Edmonton.  He has a horse team and lives mostly off the grid.

I stopped drinking Jan 1 2022 and it‚Äôs been difficult. I feel a lot better now. My depression is getting better. Here‚Äôs the thing depression is both thought based and hormone based. You need to regulate your hormones to have any chance with your depression. Alcohol is the antithesis of healthy hormone levels. Alcohol messes with your sleep and sleep is key to hormone regulation. You must stop the alcohol to have a chance. Antidepressants will not help you if you are drinking heavily. I am not sure how much you are drinking and how regularly but stopping cold turkey can be life threatening for some people so seek professional help. Alcohol will ultimately make you worse and could kill you. You just have to stop. Hopefully there is something or someone in your life that makes stopping worth the effort.

9,1,"I haven't experienced alcoholism but depression and anxiety have been a constant companion of mine for most of my life. Dozens of medication trials with some awful side effects, RTMS this year, DBT, CBT, I could go on. I've hit med burnout a few times including now. It sucks. It really does. My dad and only person I have left asked me the other day to keep pushing through each day until the right thing comes along. I've been doing that since I was in junior high; I'm in my late 30s now.

2 things I do have a little hope for are the pharmacogenetic testing I had done recently (done through a research program at the university) and am on the wait list for the inpatient program in Claresholm. 

The results from the pharmacogenetic test recommended several medications I had never tried or been recommended before while a lot of the ""recommend against"" meds are what I've tried and had awful side effects from (surprise surprise). I'm intrigued and been thinking about trying meds again. I'd recommend this this to anyone whose depression is medication resistant. Or anyone going through med trials. Had to be referred through my psychiatrist for it.

Claresholm is a longterm inpatient program that also has a branch for addictions, not just mood disorders or depression. I've never done inpatient treatment for my depression before. It terrifies me. Being admitted to a hospital terrifies me. This sounds promising though. Could be an option for you, whether it's alcohol use focused, or depression, both, everything. All covered by Alberta Health. Also needs a referral and the wait isn't horrible; I would have been there by now but am also waiting on a rheumatology referral that I'd like to be addressed first to take full advantage of Claresholm.

RTMS wasn't effective for me, but a lot of people have had life changing results from it. Not just for depression either; good results for OCD, stroke symptoms, anxiety, etc. The nurses at the foothills hospital RTMS clinic are fantastic. Also covered, but there are private clinics too.

There's a lot of options, the trick is finding something that works for you. First step in getting there is connecting with your gp, access mental health, a psychiatrist, etc.

It's a struggle. I don't pretend to know your individual struggles, but from my own experiences, I know it's hard, to say the least. It's lonely and incredibly isolating. Every day. Keep trying though.

But I didn't die somehow. I hit bottom... or as far down as I could go about 5 years ago and something in me snapped and I realized that I had to stop immediately. I suspect you're close to that, hence this post. Don't go chasing the bottom. Do not recommend.

and I know it's already been said 100 times, but...

You have to stop drinking and doing drugs. You have to find a way. Go to AA/NA, go to a clinic and get a script for Disulfiram, tell everyone you know you're quitting and you need help, anyone that offers/pressures you to drink or do drugs... cut them out of your life cause they aren't your friends, get a check in buddy(someone who checks in on you daily for the first month or so), eat as much fucking junk food as you want(I legit ate 2 tubs of ben and jerry's pretty much every day for like 6 months), get a kitten or tiny cute pet(I was gifted kittens to help me cope and they legit helped me cope(dopamine)), if you have supportive parents/family move into the basement for a year and just focus on staying sober, watch stupid cartoons, read books, color, paint, play video games, do anything to keep yourself busy/not thinking about drinking.

The first year and a half was hell for me. I had really bad PAWS(post acute withdrawal symptoms) and anxiety that was pretty crippling. But it is worth it. It was one of the best decisions of my life and I know that I will never drink again. There is life on the other side, I promise there is beauty and enjoyment and pleasure.

The worst part of quitting/cutting back for me was the withdrawal symptoms, especially at night when I tried to sleep.

So I started taking vitamin water and mixing it with a cannabis THC/CBD oil. I did this because:

1. Alcohol saps a lot of vitamins out your system sobrhe added vitamins helped a lot.

2. The anti-inflammatory and slight high I got from the cannabis products reduced the inflammation in my body and helped curb the withdrawals and cravings.

Note, that this can worsen the quality of your sleep overtime, so I wouldn't recommend doing it more than 3 days in a row.

1,2,"Growing up as a Chinese person in Saskatchewan I have faced all sorts of racism. It is not easy to attempt to de escalate a situation when emotions like anger or fear coursing through you. 

When COVID initially began I was challenged with a whole new type of scenario. I would be down town and these less than savory people would look at me with the heaviest contempt and declare that this virus was all my fault and to get my ""God your damn dirty China man ass out of here"" or something similar along those lines.

Both my grand father and dad taught me that the best fight to walk away from was one that never started.  Which is easier said than done especially when your are scared or mad. While those emotions are more than valid they do not do you any good when you want to de escalate the situation.  You just have to remind yourself to remain calm and be objective, be empathetic and understanding that the person themselves are not in their right mind, angry or afraid. 

I usually keep my head on a swivel and attempt to avoid contact all together, that means if I see someone on the street yelling or acting erratically I will do my best to remove myself from the situation by avoiding eye contact with them or crossing the street. Depending on the situation if I can I will just not acknowledge and move forward but if forced to engage, I will do my best to be respectful, speak in a calm non threatening tone but also choose my wording carefully to not be aggressive or passive aggressive. Everyone has a right to how they feel about something, that is their right even though you may not share it and if being placative gets you out of a situation alive then that is perfectly fine. There is nothing wrong with being the bigger person. I am not going to both going to different things that you can say because at the end of the day its all scenario specific.

Just remember:

Constantly be aware of your surroundings and situation.

Avoidance over engagement

Remember to breathe, Ive caught myself holding my breath sometimes. Your brain needs oxygen to think. 

Respectful placative engagement over physical

If you have to run to save your life, know where you are going. Stay in areas of public view and get to safety. 

Racism has been be apart of my entire life in one aspect or another. I havent always responded correctly but as I get older I realize that I have a lot more to lose these days and that I am nowhere near as tough as I used to be.

This isn't Texas. We aren't allowed to arm ourselves and handle things ourselves. This is Canada. We are not allowed to carry anything for self defense, not even pepper spray. While the Criminal Code does technically give us the right to use force to defend property and to even carry out citizen's arrests, almost no one ever does this and it's very discouraged by our police. People who have carried out lawful citizen's arrests have been arrested many times and the stories have been in the media. Most people don't want to take the law into their own hands - not to mention the fact that doing so is extremely dangerous, and even moreso since we cannot legally be armed. 

You can have a wild west situation where everyone carries a gun and defends their own property. Or you can have a society where police respond to minor crimes, yes, even someone stealing a bike. What you can't have is a society like ours where the cops don't do anything and we're not given the power to do anything ourselves either. This is a criminal paradise.",t3_yhagv6,Drugs or Alcohol

In downtown Toronto, every condo building will routinely be subjected to criminals breaking in and smashing cars to steal their contents (and occasionally steal the car), and any bike room gets broken into and the bikes get stolen as well. I oversaw dozens of buildings and none of them avoided this. The police do not care. At all. They won't even come. As far as they're concerned, it's a matter for insurance companies, nothing more. 

Don't expect security guards to do anything, either. They're paid minimum wage, have no weapons and almost never even have a protective vest (because those are expensive). And what could they do anyway? All a security guard can do is call the cops and cops don't respond to calls regarding breaking into cars and/or stealing bikes. 

Security guards should not do anything. It would be one thing if they were part of a team and they had weapons and vests and were paid and trained well. They are not. The best thing for them to do is stay away and stay safe. 

Unfortunately, the only defense against this kind of thing amounts to basically victim behavior adjustments. Never leave anything visible in your car - no bags, no clothes, nothing.

3,2,"It's a complicated issue. What good is it for the police to arrest someone if they'll get nearly condition-less bail the next day and then  have the case dropped by the Crown or simply get sentenced to probation despite already being on probation? One of the major problems is that there is a game of catch and release going on by the courts and Crown, part of which is because a stated goal of the system is to reduce incarceration of people from marginalized communities (incl. addicts and people with mental health challenges). The police know they can arrest the guy, waste two hours in paperwork, and have the same guy doing the same thing tomorrow. So they prioritize arresting people who are more likely to be remanded and see time. The justice system tries to be progressive, while our programs for addiction and mental health are inadequate, and nobody wants to tolerate the idea of compelling treatment. So you can't put them in jail because it's a health issue and therefore not a criminal issue (the perspective of the justice system), but you can't treat them like a health issue without express consent which they don't want to give (how many addicts are willing to volunteer for treatment and stick through with it on a wholly voluntary basis?), so they fall through the gaps.

Blame the cops if you want, but please blame Parliament for its 1995 sentencing ""reforms"" that codified principles of sentencing that involve lessening sentencing to account for marginalization and for codifying an unlimited right to bail, the judges for interpreting those laws to the maximum benefit of offenders and to the detriment of the public, prosecutors for misusing their discretion against the public interest, the province for not funding adequate mental health and  addictions treatment, and society for being uncomfortable  compelling treatment for untreated addiction and mental health even where the person is a clear risk to themselves AND others.",t3_yhagv6,Drugs or Alcohol

You can't block the flow of illicit substances into a community entirely. Much like how prohibition couldn't stop the flow of alcohol, it just changed where the alcohol was coming from, or the paths it took. But people will brew up alcohol in their bathtubs if they have to. Similar things occurs with other drugs.

>Because the socio-economic and spiritual factors putting lots of people into the state where they are despondent enough to use the drug are not even being discussed

Exactly. You can't ""tough on crime"" these problem away when these other issues aren't being addressed. People will still use drugs for a number of reasons, including just to escape their situation, or to escape any mental/physical pain.

Same thing when I lived downtown London Ontario. As heartless as this may seem, I think we need to be careful about where we put those facilities, and designate certain areas that can serve those communities where they don‚Äôt have to come into much contact with regular citizens.

His point being that many of us addicts get caught in this circular path of only refraining until using is great again.

Minneapolis traffic is way way worse than anything in Winnipeg. The heroin epidemic makes what‚Äôs happening in Winnipeg look like a joke. The housing prices are way more bonkers. Workers have less rights there, and are even less likely to get benefits.

Also the things that people in Winnipeg complain about would not even get noticed in Minneapolis. Random stabbing downtown isn‚Äôt a big deal in US cities. It would elicit very little hand wringing.

City Place / MTS Centre was the brainchild of Sam Katz and his 'Crony Promotions Crew'.  ALL of the contracts went to friends of Katz, all of the licensees and controllers of what goes down in TruNorth (formerly NighyOut Entertainment) has roots in Sam Katz deep-mining this city.

He fucked Winnipeg harder than a pig in Georgia all to sponge as much money out of this city for him and his friends.

I work in the community and am an Indigenous person. I grew up in the child welfare system and was a permanent ward until I aged out of care. Now I was placed in a home that I was fortunate to stay in for my whole duration of my placement. That gave me stability, care, and my foster family were and are great people who I am still in contact with today. I am considered one of the lucky ones. 

I have seen numerous children come in and out of my childhood home who came from abuse, exploitation, addictions, etc, who did not receive any counselling, therapy, or support from CFS. This was in the 90‚Äôs into mid 00‚Äôs, by the time I aged out CFS was in the process of disbanding under one agency and has since been split between authorities which then is divided by regions within authorities. 

I am sure you have heard about the black mark on Canada that is residential schools by now. As my own biological family as an example, my grandmother was in residential school and then my mother was placed into day school. The trauma and abuse that my grandmother suffered while in school reflected in her parenting which then was inadvertently passed on to my mother who suffered her own abuse in school and outside of it. As my mother started to have a children at a young age in the 80‚Äôs, she saw the cycle of abuse repeating itself so when CFS came to the door my mother did not know how to stop it. She was young herself and did not have the means to provide us children with safety. So we became permanent wards. 

With all of that knowledge, now think of ALL the other people in this city who have suffered similar upbringings or worse. I could have been any one of those people you see on the streets from your car/bus/bike. But I am not because I had a support system. Those people you see out there don‚Äôt or don‚Äôt know how to access those supports. Maybe they have undiagnosed mental impairments, maybe they are afraid of authorities, maybe the trauma they faced growing up is too much to face. You don‚Äôt know. 

Whatever your city did to stop homelessness is great for your previous city. Your government did what it needed to do to combat the issue, bravo to them. Winnipeg is not them and never will be, sadly. Watch how many cops, enforcement officers, downtown biz, actually get out of their vehicles and check on these people.

7,2,"> At what point in stabbing someone in the neck multiple times go from aggravated assault to attempted murder?

IANAL, but I believe attempted murder requires an actual intent to kill, in that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the assailant fully intended the victim to die. This may require motive to be proven, and I believe is a much higher and difficult charge to get a conviction.

Keep in mind, additional charges may be laid at a later time, but for the purposes of initiating the arrest and detaining this person they may have just started out with aggravated assault, knowing full well that if it goes to trial based on that alone they can get a conviction. If they go right to attempted murder, there is a higher possibility that the accused will be able to successfully defend the charges, so they need to make sure their case is air tight before they escalate to those charges. That would come after the investigation. But in this case it appears that it was fairly random (guy was in the restaurant for an hour beforehand), likely drugs and alcohol are involved (previously charged with meth and arson offences), and there is likely no video of the assault to show what was said or what transpired beforehand to cause the attack (someone who works there commented on the lack of video in a previous thread). Obviously if there was video of the guy saying ""I'm going to stab you until you die! I'm going to kill you!"" that might go a long way to escalating to attempted murder.",t3_1459krj,Drugs or Alcohol

News release
Jan. 31, 2024    Boissevain, Manitoba         Canada Border Services Agency/Royal Canadian Mounted Police

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are committed to safeguarding our country by keeping illegal and dangerous drugs from reaching our communities.

On January 14, 2024, CBSA officers discovered and seized 406.2 kg of suspected methamphetamine, approximately 4 million illicit doses valued at over $50,780,000, following the examination of a commercial truck at the Boissevain port of entry in southern Manitoba. This is the largest seizure of illegal narcotics to occur in the Prairie Region. The driver was carrying a shipment destined for Winnipeg.

The driver was arrested by the CBSA and transferred to the Manitoba RCMP along with the suspected narcotics.

The driver of the truck has been charged with the following offences:

¬∑         Importation of Methamphetamine contrary to section 6(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; and

¬∑         Possession of a Controlled Substance for the Purpose of Trafficking contrary to section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

The individual is scheduled to appear in Manitoba Law Courts on February 1, 2024",t3_1afnaxf,Drugs or Alcohol

7,2,I was a meth user for quite some time and to be quite frank I never did anything criminal except purchase drugs for my own consumption. I made a terrible decision after the breakup of my marriage which led me on the path of addiction but I refused to stoop to theft or fraud or selling myself or others to get drugs. I worked to get my fix and it took 15 years but I got out of that trap.  I CAME to the conclusion that I deserved better and hated the majority of the people who used they were narcissistic filled with anger and hate and were selfish thinking only of themselves. I managed after a lot of effort to wien myself off it and I am not some superman with willpower I screw and have fallen off the wagon but I am persistent and those occurrences have Dwindled.  A lot of people blame the drug for the behavior of meth heads but frankly I never stopped caring about the well being of others and I would back then bend backwards to try and help others with their issues and I never asked for anything in return. Sadly many took my kindness and used it to their advantage and I had a lot of my belongings stolen. I Believe if you are a good person and were raised with good morals that no drug can change that unless you want to become something less moral. That's my 2 cents on it. And its my own opinion based on my experiences when I was deep in the throws of addiction. The ones that you see acting all messed up are just a fraction of the total number of people using meth. The ones like myself typically are busy at home doing normal things so you don't ever see that side. So please don't lump all meth heads into the evil category some of us made a mistake and the addiction itself is a terrible punishment in and of itself for the mistake of trying it.

As these problems get worse it becomes more and more expensive and daunting to try and manage the issues. Especially when you‚Äôre being ruled over by a government that believes that it‚Äôs just people‚Äôs poor choices that landed them in their situation and therefore it‚Äôs their own fault and the government should not be intervening in that way. We don‚Äôt have a society anymore it seems, we have a corporation and our CEO and their ilk want only to extract and give nothing back. 

As an anecdotal thing I have a family member who is a teacher and they expect to get a whole classroom of kids coming into grade seven with a grade one or less reading comprehension. How in the hell are you going to teach 20 something kids to read at their level as well as teaching them the government mandated curriculum in one year? The answer is, you‚Äôre not with the current way we do things. And so they will be passed on to the next year until they ‚Äògraduate‚Äô and probably end up in the prison system. The can has been kicked down the road so far it‚Äôs hard to imagine how we are going to fix these systemic issues.

We need leaders who are intelligent, compassionate and have common sense as well as a burning desire to help all people in society not just those in their economic bracket. As far as I can tell, even if there are these people it seems unlikely they would ever get enough power to do anything meaningful.

That‚Äôs just my two cents.",t3_vtk52a,Drugs or Alcohol
7,2,"The issue that everyone seems to be facing when talking about getting mental health support programs funded;  is that everyone is approaching this as ""Someone else needs to do something""  or ""the government needs to dedicate resources to X"".

What I struggle to convey to people is that:    The government is just a group of people doing what they are influenced to do. 

If people really want to help and to improve mental health support in Winnipeg:   

* Donate money to a mental health and support programs
* Convince others to do the same or to support other mental health and support programs
* Contact your city councillor and let them know what you are doing, ask them to do what they can to help
* Reach out to other consistence in your district and have honest conversations about what change you want to see and discuss how they can help

If anyone can convince the majority to prioritize mental health support programs and they all understand why/how/where their tax dollars are going to do in support of such a program:  Great, change will happen. 


The sad truth of the matter is:   the majority of people in Manitoba are ""ok"" with the status quo and don't want to spend any more money to change things. This influences politicians to avoid ""breaking things"" and thus here we are.

I feel that the only way things are going to change here in Manitoba is if someone:

1. Comes forward with a platform of wanting to improve mental health supports AND reduce ongoing costs
2. Finance the startup of said programs from the planned future savings to the police/fire budgets(*)
3. Actually follow through with shifting those resources and seeing the cost savings materialize. 


Number 2 there => This is the hardest part of the whole thing.    Putting programs in place is not an overnight fix;  they will need to co-exist with NOW for many years;   maybe 15 years or more!
Getting someone to actually finance and deploy the needed capital NOW for some savings that _might_  materialize down the road is a really hard sell.    

If I had the slightest clue of how to make this happen:  I'd be shouting it from the rooftops;  but the sad fact is that I like most cannot prove anything on paper and thus most people would prefer the status quo.",t3_vtk52a,Drugs or Alcohol

The community organizing this is trying to show that the criminalization and prohibition of drug use is more of a detriment to our society than having it legalized. The ‚Äúfree‚Äù stamp is what people get hung up on, but the idea is to provide a safe supply so that there are less overdoses and ill side effects caused by laced drugs, and in turn create fewer ambulance visits and hospitalizations. There is already so much money coming from healthcare to take care of addicted homeless population that the money saved could be used for more proactive approaches.

There are multiple pillars of support that need to be established, and removing the unsafe drugs from circulation is one of them. Another would be to decriminalize usage of these drugs and provide a safe way to use/obtain them, where there would be additional support pillars available in forms of free counselling, addiction treatments, rehabs, etc. 

You can‚Äôt just forget about the people that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want help‚Äù because a lot of them do, they have just been forced into a lifestyle where this is their normal, and they don‚Äôt know or forgot how to function without the drugs.

I agree that more should be done regarding this issue, I think everyone does. I think a big problem is that whatever we try to do will get vilified because it isn‚Äôt working right away. Even with a perfect plan this issue will take a long time for recovery, possibly a generation, and we shouldn‚Äôt hope to fix every part of it. Not everyone will want treatment, not everyone will want to live differently, not everyone will agree that whatever is being done is the best support method, but we need to keep trying and hopefully be at a better place than we were before. We need to continue to treat the root problem, but keep bandaids on the symptoms until the right support pillars are built and available.

This would completely cut out the black market and also ensure consistent quality. 

There's no practical reason why drugs that are currently illegal can't be made in a legal, safe way just like any other pharmaceutical. This is actually what we used to do back before they were illegal, when you could find things like children cough medicine with cocaine in it on any pharmacy shelf haha. 

The overall philosophy is that people who can consistently access free/low cost clean drugs are way less likely to overdose and die, less likely to commit financially motivated crimes, and spend less of their day to day life in an endless cycle of sourcing money/sourcing drugs/ using drugs/ starting withdrawal/ repeat repeat repeat.

I remember one time, there was a group shooting up,and something was wrong a woman was screaming and giving cpr - i stopped and asked if they called the ambulance she said yes I said I would go up to the road and signal them in (they were in an area that was hard to see)  transit cops saw me first i waved them in.  They stopped right away and said what is it with wide and alert eyes.  Told them the situation they, were less alert and was like... Oh...ok...""lah dee dah"" except for the one woman cop.  asked them if that person will be ok.  ""Maybe, just another junkie"" I was disturbed to hear that, but it says a lot when people who are Frontline workers has that attitude...can't blame them, from suffering burnout.

Nope.  Because giving someone who is an addict whatever they want whenever they want without doing anything will then make those lose motivation to do anything isn't cost effective either.

Have you heard of those temp agency places?  A lot of those people are normally drug addicts - they sweep the floor, clean construction sites, nothing too difficult or dangerous.  But they are doing something productive and moving around and contributing to something at least, and have some structure or time to detox.  After working they will get hungry so they will go buy something to eat at least.  THEN get high.  If you give free drugs it takes away any motivation to do anything that day.

I'm not surprised.  It is a limited implementation of what should be a province-wide program.

Social services case workers should be able to help people get safe drugs, and at the same time take the opportunity to help people get the help they need to get OFF drugs (if they want to).

Take money out of the hands of criminals, keep addicts alive long enough for them to seek treatment, reduce petty crime because people aren't drug seeking, reduce impact on medical services because people aren't OD-ing.

The public safety side of it tor me is the fact that we give people passes for violence and crimes when they have addictions.

When drug addicts realize how drugs are causing a negative impact on their lives, they can make the decision to sober up. It's much easier to sober up when you are 100% committed to it. 

Another thing to keep in mind is a lot of people who use drugs aren't addicts. Much like how someone who enjoys an occasional glass of wine at a party isn't an alcoholic, someone who does cocaine or MDMA at a party might not be a drug addict. Safe supply isn't just about making it safe for hardcore users. It's also about the many people who casually use controlled substances. 

Finally I think a big part of it is to build a stronger mental health system to help people before they get addicted and to better help people get off drugs when they are ready.",t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,"It's incredibly hard to get, like the other person said - and when you do get it, it's fucking nothing. Less than 1500 a month. Oh, but wait: If you live with someone who's not disabled, it gets cut down even further, so no, fuck you, you can't just live with a roommate to make that $1500 go far enough. Disabled people in Vancouver are basically forced to either live with another disabled person, or find someone very wealthy to live with, or move - and that last one often isn't an option due to needing specialized medical services.

I can't ever move in with my girlfriend simply because I don't make enough money to support 2 people, but it *would* be manageable if they wouldn't cut her support from ""meagre"" to ""breadcrumbs"" for daring to live with me.

8,2,Yeah. You know what could prevent someone from ODing from bad product? Forced rehab. You can't steal a bike or take that fatal dose from a padded cell. In the same way criminals have their freedoms restricted (not here of course) those that are a danger to themselves and others also need to be placed in institutions.

8,2,"If the junkies dont get their fix they will steal for it, so just give them the drugs, its cheaper.",t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,Sadly it won't though for 3 reasons. 1) Addicts will always want more. So when they get cut off from their government supply or don't get enough they will go right back to the street for their fix. (And all the behaviours that go along with it) 2) Creating a drug culture will lead to more people on drugs and less incentive for recovery.  3) The program will attract junkies from all across Canada. Advocates want all the benefits of harm reduction but none of the consequences of civil disobedience. We will have an even larger population of addicts with no means by which to hold them accountable.,t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,"Exactly this, Portugal's big push was to classify addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal issue. Spending on the mental health system skyrocketed and their incidences or drug related crime, death, and addiction dropped",t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,What were you talking about then? I didn't mention any numbers and was specifically talking about casual drug users.,t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,These people are already addicts. Regardless of what led them to addiction they now have a brain disease and regardless of where they get them they will still use drugs. Doing so through safe channels is cheaper for us between policing and healthcare. And provides easier access to users whenever those resources are available to actually treat them.,t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,you know that even in rehab people can't safely cold turkey off of things right? and it takes time for people to go to rehab? and strong arming people into rehab is gonna make things more likely to go badly? Do you want people off drugs or do you want to punish people? I think it's the latter. I don't think we can have an effective evidence based conversation about harm reduction and actual improvement in risk behaviour.,t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,"So they stay addicts, except the government provides the free pharmaceutical grade stuff to them.

Force treatment, that can't continue forever",t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,"Portugal has a very strong system of enforcement  actually. If your drug use creates a problem for anyone, and that ranges from things like public intoxication, overdose, public nuisance, theft, etc you are brought to an administrative council where you are assessed and usually forced to go into rehabilitative treatment 

People whose drug use doesn't result in personal or societal harms can continue to use, but those who manage poorly are required to attend treatment 
 

Additionally, traffickers and drug dealers are intensely punished, with some of the strictest sentencing in europe. Supply side is still criminalized, while demand /user side is decriminalized but still administratively governed


I don't know why people leave out this part of the policy when discussing portugal",t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,"You are still twisting what I said. Please stop being a sophist. Being a drug addict is simply being a drug addict. It's a mental health issue that is medically recognised as such. I wish there were more help for people with mental and physical disabilities and non-disabled, non-wealthy citizens of our region and province. Currently the social safety net does not help many people. This is a major problem. You seem to endorse living in a Chicago School of Economics--Hayekian--Friedmanesqe dystopia.

8,2,"I am all for weaning people off drugs in rehab. Who said cold turkey? Putting people in rehab vs jail when then have shown that they are not able to integrate into civilized society seems like the most ethical thing to do. Portugal provides harm reduction and strong action (including forced rehab)when people repeat the same self destructive behaviors. That's the difference - you want to enable people and normalize drug use. People like me actually want a solution as opposed to fuelling the poverty industry through pro-drug advocacy. 360M a year goes into all the wonderful programs that you support in the DTES. Look where it got us - we are the shame of all North America. Harm Reduction is not only pointless but dangerous without the other 3 pillars - prevention, treatment and enforcement. Funny how you people want nothing to do with the latter 3.",t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,"Like, it's not like it's a free for all and drugs are free flowing, no! They are still heavily restricted more so than alcohol, but like alcohol if you get fucked up and are a douche, you have to face the consequences",t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol

8,2,"The city doesn‚Äôt fund cancer research. Nor does agreeing to this (privately funded) program prevent drug use prevention if that‚Äôs what you think will solve the problem. 

This is cheaper than what we‚Äôre currently doing and reduces addictions burden on the healthcare system.

Again, becoming addicted and being an addict are not the same thing. One is a social issue, one is a medical issue.",t3_q3pdnz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,2,"we do need the other pillars, but our policing system is *broken*. I say this as someone who grew up with family members who worked in the RCMP. Additionally, the judicial system has been picking up the slack in BC because we lack meaningful support services in social service and healthcare branches. Including housing, culturally competent care, accessible addictions counselling, peer groups, nursing, etc. This leaves the bulk of management on police and the judicial system, who have admitted themselve they are not the best people for it and are literally buckling under the strain of it. 

I've taken multiple courses on this. The solution isn't make cops take people to rehab. It's force the government to meaningfully fund the social safety net again so that we aren't relying on cops who aren't actually trained in intervention, or EMTs who are completely burnt out. It's looking into the controversy-fraught nonprofit and slumlord housing industries (hello Sahotas) that profit off of the government subsidies for housing and push for better alternatives, maybe even bringing them under direct government supervision (and therefore democratic accountability). Funding culturally competent care in Chinatown for example, or for Indigenous people, which makes menaingdul differences in the root causes of issuse. Fund research in the causes of addiction.

I don't really care about how much money we spend, I care that its spent well. I agree that it isn't spent well. I think we disagree on perspective. I have a small background in this. Overly punitive methods on the individual directly tend to worsen results. I care about results, I hope you do too.

To be fair, if the government is not interested in helping/funding, what else can be done by a few people with a small budget that just want less OD deaths?

I would think the issue is quite complex and would require legalization, better rehab support, as well as financial and community support. Living in such a high cost of living city with such little sense of community is a huge obstacle to having a decent life for many people here.

One issue is that the resources to help people with addictions and poverty are insufficient. The consequences of that are spilling out into other parts of society.

Another issue is that transit is underfunded. There should be more trains, and fares should be cheaper. You shouldn‚Äôt have to wait so long between trains.

Lock them up and throw away the key? That's morally deprived and unbecoming of a healthy, wealthy, modern democracy. Give them free reign of certain areas? That's inviting serious crime problems within those areas and areas surrounding them. Legalize all drugs, sell them openly, and tax them?

We have ~3000 homeless people in the city and 1150 beds to put them in. That‚Äôs why so many sleep rough until it‚Äôs brutally cold. 

Which leads us to: its winter time! That means our shelters are **absolutely** over capacity. You don‚Äôt even need to check. Every year, homeless people die during cold snaps because there are not enough beds. Like the cold snap that hit us this weekend. The other alternative to ‚Äúfreezing to death‚Äù in these situations is to get yourself arrested or hang out in heated spaces like a train or heated bus stop. 

Of the eight homeless shelters in the city, 2 are for families and most of the other 6 *will not house you if you‚Äôre on drugs*. So, that means we have only a few places willing to provide shelter to addicts.

We also have ONE safe consumption site in the city at Chumir. That‚Äôs it.

Want more? Cool - I‚Äôve got more! 

If you want to get off the drugs, you need to get onto a waitlist to get into detox because you can‚Äôt go to rehab until you‚Äôve been off the drugs for 2-4 weeks, depending on the place. Some rehab places bake the detox time in, but this is not always the case. 

Getting a detox spot can take weeks of standing in line every day waiting for an opening and rehab waitlists are about 6-12 **months**. People with serious addictions - like fentanyl - will probably die before they can find a rehab opening. 

Of course this all changes if you have access to private services, but most drug addicts don‚Äôt have $20k in their couch cushions to access those options. 

Most of my info is from pre-COVID, so you can bet your sweet bippy that all of these issues have gotten worse over the last couple of years.

9,2,"That's just it, this thread is mostly people talking about their experiences on Calgary Transit. The c-train including the platforms and stations are a shitshow these days - morning, noon and night, and have been for two years. (And it was NOT great pre-pandemic.)

I posted another comment in this thread about how I've rearranged my work and life, including changing jobs to avoid taking transit, no longer carry a purse or wear headphones because I felt so unsafe and isolated as a woman going about her business during the first year of the pandemic. It really did feel like an episode of the Walking Dead out there on many mornings.

I think the difference in size of the two cities, and as someone mentioned above, Calgary having more homeless per capita, also plays into it.

I left Toronto a few years ago and can concede that it's probably gotten worse as it has everywhere. And I know TO has major issues with all of this as well.

I know there were encampments in TO when I was there. I just don't recall ever being harassed by GROUPS of street people/homeless/addicts in TO. Whereas that is a weekly occurrence for me in YYC. It's not daily, because I've mastered a pretty good ""don't fuck wit' me"" vibe and stare when I'm out and about.

I live in the Beltline and work downtown. On a daily basis I am running a gauntlet of mouthy, aggressive streetpeople, or giving a wide berth to someone in the throes of a high, with flailing arms and yelling, or bent over with their pants down. I get asked for every single takeout container in my hands. I have called the DOAP team on many occasions because I'm not completely soulless.

And I will say that many times here, they mind their own business and don't bother me. But the train is a MESS.

It's depressing man. And every single day I wonder what the fuck I'm still doing here. (Spoiler alert - it's about money.)

9,2,"I‚Äôd be interested to read that article! I didn‚Äôt see it in the thread, so I can only speculate. I‚Äôd say if they were speaking to capacity overall in the city, it‚Äôs likely the open beds were at places that mandate no drug use (it‚Äôs usually the religious ones, like Mustard Seed), which doesn‚Äôt help with the problem in OP. 

The Medicine Hat solution is really neat and I wish our city council would commit to it (I think they piloted something in 2019), but it‚Äôs a hard sell to the public, especially the ‚ÄúI work hard for my [money/home/groceries] so why should someone else get it free/with my tax dollars?‚Äù crowd. 

Basically, it lives up to its name: if you‚Äôre homeless, the first step is getting you a home, *then* the city connects you with appropriate services and supports. They don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre on drugs, you get a place to live that isn‚Äôt a row of bunk beds you share with strangers or the cold brick of the entryway to a local church. It‚Äôs like a real place with a kitchen and bathroom and it‚Äôs yours. Then the next priorities are harm reduction, community and social integration, and individualized support and programs. 

It saves money on healthcare costs, judicial system costs, policing, shelters, and other emergency services. Not to mention the admin and bureaucracy you can slash out of the middle.  

The best part, IMHO, is you can just access every support or program from one place. So you can just focus on getting better instead of dealing with 6 different government agencies across 3 levels of government and 4 NGOs (+ potentially missing out on supports that would make a difference because you didn‚Äôt know they existed). 

People are significantly more likely to succeed at difficult things if they feel safe. We can be super resilient and push ourselves to some crazy extremes if we feel safe. Quitting drugs is super hard; quitting without safety/still homeless would be heroic^6. 

If you don‚Äôt like the term ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, you can think of this as simply providing the base layers of Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs, so people have capacity leftover to deal with their addiction. 

Including the fact the some of the units get trashed and need repairs, the cost savings are still substantial. Something like $2 in public savings for every $1 spent. 

Plus - most people stay housed after. Which should really be the biggest metric of the programs success. 

Having helped a family member navigate our current system over the last two decade, I‚Äôm pretty excited about the possibility that we might start doing something that actually works.

Experience one:

I was taking the train southbound from Downtown as I work in the SE. I used to get on at 3rd street station I believe? There were two people who were drunk off their hats, and looking back I shouldn't have sat anywhere near them and just stood but whatever.

I wouldn't mention this any other time but it is relative to the story, they were indigenous. I understand how badly they have been and are treated, but they proceeded to scream at every single caucasian person that got onto the train just trying to mind their own business, went off about how ""we"" stole the land and ruined their lives. I had my headphones in but kept the volume low enough to hear what they were saying. They then proceeded to attack me saying that I was just a stupid kid probably talking to my friends about stupid things on my phone (I am a 25f). Then one of them grabbed my arm and threatened to kill me if I didn't get off the train. I looked at them dead pan in the eyes and said ""I deserve to be here as much as you do"" and then went to the opposite side of the train and texted the help line thing.

For perspective this happened in spring of 2022. I was so shaken by this interaction. Usually I don't try to cause conflict so this was very frightening for me, I didn't know what they had on them.

&#x200B;

Experience 2: Summer of 2022

I started taking the 302 BRT  to and from work when I switched store location, this person was drunk and had a knife of them and was threatening people in the back of the bus with it. Bus driver had to pull over and get cops to escort them off of the bus. They didn't threaten me but I was again, so shaken after that cause who knows what could've happened.

&#x200B;

I enrolled in driving school and got my car on the road within a matter of like 2 months after the second incident because I will never take transit again unless I absolutely have to. Suffering cause my insurance is like $350.00 but I really don't care anymore.

Sarcasm aside, homelessness is a complex problem.  There is no one single solution, or even an easy solution.  Nobody wants to be confronted with the ugly reality of the downtrodden on their daily commute but that's a reality for far too many people in our city.  On the flip side, too often people are far too sensitive, with the simple sight of a rough looking character sleeping on a bench enough for them to scream 'unsafe!'.  People need to toughen up a bit and learn that there's a difference between 'undesirable' and 'unsafe'.

Just a suggestion, but maybe it needs to start in the schools with better drug education. Right now you have ""lame teachers"" telling kids it's not ""cool"" to do drugs, usually with stupid little songs and forcing kids to promise never to try drugs. Why not create a curriculum that actually shows kids what happens to your brain, teeth, lungs, etc. Teach them that you're not special and able to just stop when you want and show them that's because of what happens in your brain to prevent you from stopping. Maybe it needs to get a bit gore-y to really scare kids away from drugs. Maybe have kids learn to budget and show them all the fun things they could spend their money on, then take it all away because that's what would be spent on drugs. They should have to see visuals of all of these homeless people sleeping on the streets and know it's because of drugs that they got there.

I think the problem with drug education right now is it's usually a one assembly and done kind of thing. Kids need persistent teaching for things like this to sink in. It needs to be hammered into their brains that drugs are dangerous and scary and to be avoided at all costs or they'll face hideous consequences.

9,2,"I witnessed a very similar thing at the Lion's Park train station a little while ago. A man hit the ground and was unresponsive! He had a couple friends with him that were able to give him a shot of narcan, I ran to the help button <but it didn't work!!!> so I quickly called 911.

In the meantime his friends (about three people) were attempting CPR and the guy was given another shot of narcan!! Everyone in the area was trying to help, including a THIRD person with a narcan kit trying to cross the tracks to the other side!! I remember the guy had blue lips!  


The ambulance siren is the best sound in the world when you are the one that called for it, I just felt like help was on the way, and the guy would be alright...  


The guy WAS alright, he actually came back to life about 30 seconds before the ambulance showed up, his friends had done what they could to save him. The guy stood up and walked around, he said ""what happened?"" and his friend was so proud of himself saying ""You died man, I saved your life, man!!"" - the EMT's said that ""yup, you were dead, and if it wasn't for your friend and the narcan, you would still be dead""  


The train I needed to be on to get home showed up then, so I got on. I was crying uncontrollably the rest of my way home. I phoned my boyfriend and talked to him about it, but I didn't tell anyone else about what I saw - just went back to work like nothing happened the next day.

9,2,"I had a similar experience in early December at a NE grocery store. As I was leaving the store, a young addict I've seen in the area was immediately outside the exit, trying to get on his bike. He lost it & fell, hard, hitting his head on the guardrail around the exit and a second time on a brick curbing.  
He hit the ground, motionless, eyes open but rolled back. I set my bag of groceries down by his head to try to partially stabilize his neck while I checked for vitals....old habits die hard; I am a retired senior citizen, who spent 40 years responding to aviation emergencies, and a bunch more years on a couple of different Search & Rescue teams, both Calgary & other Provinces, so it ""wasn't my first Rodeo""  
A quick assessment showed no respiration or heartbeat. I started CPR & asked another man watching to call 911. After a couple of minutes, a young womancame up, said she was a nurse and knew CPR. I handed off to her, caught my breath (if you've never performed CPR, it's exhausting!) and ran to my car, which was parked quite close.  
I keep a fairly comprehensive first aid kit in my trunk, including Narcan ( you can pick up kits, free of charge & anonymously if you wish, at any pharmacy in Alberta. if you don't have one, you should).  
I also have an inflatable neck collar; my first concern was he may have broken his neck when he fell so hard, and I didn't want to paralyze him, trying to keep him going until EMS got there.

I got back, put the collar on him, and got the Narcan ready. I hadn't given it a thought until that second; it was -21C, the solution HAD to have frozen, although it seemed liquid since I was holding it while I got everything else ready; I figured a dose of previously frozen narcan wouldn't do More damage if he's already dead for the most part.  
I gave him the Narcan, and was starting to switch off with the nurse who'd been doing one person CPR for a few minutes, when I got punched in the face. The narcan seemed to have worked. I got punched a couple more times, got my nose bloodied. The Fire Dept. arrived, then the Police & Paramedics. I passed off what I knew & left.  
I know he survived; one of the paramedics knew him by name; he was a ""frequent Flyer"" and had OD'd a couple of weeks earlier. I also saw him on his bike during the holidays  
I was PAID to know what to do, for a lot of years. Evem though I'm not, now...I haven't forgotten everything.

9,2,"Hey man I want to share with you a similar experience that I had so you know you are not alone in dealing with this

I driver for Uber in Calgary it's my full time job. On Halloween two years ago it was my first Halloween ever driving a cab and I expected things to be really crazy. Well it was. I picked up a semi-intoxicated man from Inglewood/Ramsey outside the Bar-cade there I don't remember the name - Not Gretta, but also fuck Gretta from a driver standpoint they WAY over serve every vom / near vom in my car has been from that place - He acknowledged that the Uber was for him and that we were going to the right place. I did not give him a second thought he looked totally fine.

I took the right turn from Memorial to get onto Deer Foot and he kid car inertia style tumbled into my seat (he was sitting passenger side back seat). It made this huge crash and I said ""dude are you ok? put that seat belt on for me."" He did and then almost immediately slumped over passed out. Fair enough I assumed he was just very drunk. A little worried since he was totally fine getting into the car. When I pulled up to his drop off spot he was gone. Locked in. If you have ever seen someone stuck in the k-hole you would notice the signs. Guy was awake, breathing suppressed but no conscious thought going on.

I helped him out of the car and it was READILY apparently he was not ok. Immediately fell down onto the ground. I told him ""dude if you can't get the the door I have to call an ambulance,"" I was not expecting a response because I have seen this type of OD before. I did NOT have a Naloxone kit in my car. I was really new at Uber at this point and had no idea that I would have to deal with this type of thing on a regular basis. I called 911 through the Uber app (this is done for my own safety as it gives Uber a record that I did so) Talked to the 911 operator described the issue, non responsive, suppressed breathing etc. BTW the 911 operator was awesome as fuck. Big thank you if you are out there, you really helped me get through it & I totally appreciate it. I was maybe 20 blocks from the rockey-view so they got their fast and took control etc. Never heard from him again no idea if he survived, but now I keep a Naloxone Kit with me at all times. Because I will have to use it to save someone's life.

**What you need to hear right now**

You got this. This is a traumatic event I know but you are going to be ok.

You did the right thing and kept another human being safe. No one can take away from you that you acted correctly and like a decent guy.

Naloxone kits are 100% free from Pharmacies. If you are worried about the future you can pick one up and carry it with you in a backpack etc. Naloxone is safe to inject into pretty much anyone (according to the packaging) so you don't have to worry about hurting someone with it. If you are worried about administering the pharmacist can show you & when you call EMS or talk to EMS through someone they can tell you to administer or not. Personally I feel better just knowing I have one.

The only real thing that will help is talking to people and time. Took me quite a while to not worry about my guy. You just have to hope he is ok and that this helps him turn a corner in his life.

TLDR: I had it happen in my car and it can really shake you up. DM me if you need someone to talk to who has been through this experience more than once. Also FUCK GRETTA

Honestly, try engaging a lot of these people, try pointing out how these were all previous issues with the NDP and you'll get some cope about how the PC or UCP were sabotaging them, or that they were too busy cleaning up previous administrations' messes etc. these aren't nuanced or honest opinions, it's just Flames vs. the Bruins 

They also gloss over and take as a given that social programs work in the first place, that money is well spent and that more money equates to proportional benefit.

Even then, it's not like the posters are really pouring over provincial budgets. A few token programs making up like 1% of social welfare spending are blown up to represent a UCP war on poverty. Not so, the UCP toss a ton of money at social services, programs, subsidized housing etc. not to mention the free drugs, healthcare, emergency services etc. which have been staples since the 80's anyway. The real point to criticize is that the UCP is very ""conservatively"" adding on more debt to pay for basically the same outlays/budget as the NDP.

Both ""distinct"" political parties in the province engage in corporate welfare, and the solution isn't to redistribute free money more equitably, it's to shut it off entirely.

In defense of cutting off the social programs: first of all, since everyone loves science so much, how exactly is one to ""prove"" the social programs work. For every dollar spent on programs you get 1 less ""bad social number""? where's the control? how are administrators even measuring this metric? what's the common denominator. If you fund a social ill, you are in effect ""paying for it"", and the usual progression is: 1) fund the problem 2) notice the problem gets progressively worse anyway 3) hire a massive army of ""administrators"", accountants, data analysts to discover why the problem keeps getting worse. It's a matter of incentives and basic human psychology, there's not some technocratic magik to solve the issue after hundreds of years of trying the same thing.

Some of us actually know problem individuals. First you lend them money, it doesn't get repaid. Maybe you let them couch surf and you get all your stuff stolen. Social programs are often the same. Get stitched up? the wound goes gangrenous, meds not taken. Given subsidized housing? interior trashed, neighbors suffer, get a shot of narcan and thousands in EMS care? overdose again an hour later.

All of this partisanship is nonsense. You can't vote with your dollar with government, so regardless of the administration, you're dealing with a monopoly provider you can't defund for failing or ""vote with your dollar"" - oh, but you can try to cut ineffective programs or fire unneeded staff, but you're perpetually held hostage by the former religious beliefs about the effectiveness of the welfare state.

Homelessness and crime will only increase as the government becomes more deranged and woke. The political elite will continue to insulate themselves from actually dealing with the problems of the commoners.

Despite the programs, there is a population of people who simply can't care for themselves and will always be a burden to those around them. Everyone will continue to pussyfoot around the necessity of bringing back the asylum system, rather than letting them roam around as knife wielding outpatients or brazenly smoking drugs inside your train car. If you're not a fan of forceful confinement, you can also simply kick people out of the city if you want to be less tyranni

For the marginal who have fallen through the cracks: most productive people on all ends of the political system are generous, and thank god we have enough capitalism to have an excess of wealth. Social programs are the ""democratic will"" of the people, so we can certainly rely on ""the people"" to cover those with hope via private charity, unless there is some magically transformative experience that happens via voting that we're not aware of.",t3_s51wnh,Drugs or Alcohol

As a guy who drives a few dozen people to these shelters each month, you only need to be able to stand up to qualify for the DI / Alpha. I've taken in piss soaked junkies that are coming down and never been turned away.

However, shelter rules exist for a reason. The safety of staff and other clients is imperative. There are barriers, because there are rules. There is no such thing as a shelter without rules. Rules exist as a result of incidents. Incidents that are medical or violent in nature that result in liability concerns...

I was at the DI last December when the encampments were broken up outside. Homeless people sheltered in tents all around the DI. The mayor condemned enforcement for smashing down their tents. *""You think people want go just be outside in -35...""* Yes. Inside the shelter was only at about 75% occupancy. Transit buses were being staged to transport overflow to alternate arrangements. We couldn't talk them into the shelter because **rules**.

After cleaning up the camp the mayor was outraged. Public messaging and media coverage were clear. They did NOT want enforcement to engage with the homeless. So enforcement backed off. Less than 48 hours later a fire broke out at the tents surrounding the DI. When CFD arrived they couldn't access the fire hydrant to put out the fire, because one tent was built over top of the hydrant. It almost lead to concerns for the entire shelter... Suddenly the mayor changes her tune. Takes part in safety meetings with Transit, and actually agrees with prohibiting access to certain Transit properties after hours lol. Why? Because there are objective safety concerns and certain people can not be housed because of an unwillingness to participate.

Rules exist for a reason. There are people who would prefer to camp outside in -35 instead of listening to basic rules. You will never be able to build a shelter without rules because as the agency responsible for the shelter, you will become liable for safety concerns and unsafe conditions. As someone who is actually involved with the most vulnerable population, and have been for over a decade, this is the reality of the situation. I encourage you to get involved as well. Funding is always an issue, but shelters sit largely vacant. Public programs get cancelled each year due to a lack of participation.

No its just a job. I'm able to separate my personal opinion from my professional-self. Its like wearing a mask. My job doesn't have room for personal opinion, so I leave that at home. And when I leave work, I leave work at work. Rules and barriers are the same thing. Not being able to access a shelter because you're intoxicated is a rule (at some shelters). It is also a barrier. But it is a rule for good reason. Not all shelters are equipped for intoxicated individuals.

* It doesn't have to be either-or in terms of money. Address transit safety and try to address the broader social issues. However, transit safety shouldn't be dependent on the broader social issues facing society that fluctuate with time.
* Transit agencies are not responsible for solving these broader issues. Higher levels of government are. When transit agencies try to do more than their mandate, they are limited and often do so poorly. Transit is for moving people around, not solving broader social issues that would anyways be more effectively solved by other government branches.
* The idea is to make transit safer. We will never be at the point to eradicate these social issues, and not everyone suffering from them is willing to. Though these issues are rampant, they needn't be disproportionately concentrated onto transit.

I am not familiar with those specific German cities. However, there are many cities that DO have those issues (i.e., Vancouver, New York, San Francisco, etc.) and have been wise to implement fare gates to varying degrees of efficacy.

The cops don‚Äôt go to chinook to stop the 40 people shooting up and smoking meth in the heated barns, because it would be a total PR nightmare and also require probably a hundred officers.  So the problem get a worse.

In the last two months at chinook station on my way home from work I‚Äôve experienced all sorts of violence. Including one fella who decided it was his territory or nobodies; so he proceeded to smash the glass walls of the heated shelter with a baton before laying into the people inside who he didn‚Äôt like.

One weapon call from Transit can scoop up most of their available resources for an hour or more. I also dont think people realize how frequently transit officers are making arrests and transporting people around to facilities. Transit Officers have essentially become a homeless taxi. Engage with someone sleeping or doing drugs. Run them for warrants. Transport them and book them... This all takes time. And for every 1-2 they remove off the train, there are 10 more. And as soon as the ones they transport get to their destination, they're released just as quickly and are back on the transit line. This is all to say, if you see a guy ""threatening strangers"" and aren't seeing immediate officers, there is something worse happening somewhere else or there simply is not enough manpower to send anyone, because they are tied up transporting someone else. There is no circumstance where someone is actively assaulting or threatening people, and officers are simply opting to turn their radios off and continue to issue no-fare violation tickets to 'easier targets' while being monitored on camera by their dispatchers lol. Its easy to look at an event infront of you and say 'geesh, someone should be here dealing with this', without seeing a monitor that reveals exactly how many current events are happening and waiting to have officers dispatched while simultaneously looking at dozens of monitors and observing officers actively dealing with drug and weapons calls.

2,3,"I guess this is a controversial opinion, but I enjoyed it. 

I think the exhibit did a great job showcasing the era and time that Basquiat lived in and what influenced his artwork. 

He was an artist growing and learning in 1960s-1980s New York City. I really had no idea how much his life intersected with other artists/musicians of that era too, like Madonna, Debbie Harry (of Blondie), Keith Haring and others. It was fun to imagine them all partying together.

They also did a halfway decent job at showcasing his impact on early Hip-Hop (which, at least back then, was considered a confluence of Rap music, Break-dancing and Graffiti). I took a class about early Hip-Hop back in University that mainly focused on rap, and it was nice to get a more rounded view of the time. 

As for the rooms dedicated to his journal entries... I had mixed emotions. It was kind of great as an opportunity to get into his mental state during the time he was most active. But, it was clear to me his mental state was mostly unwell. There were poems mixed in with grocery lists, fever-dream ramblings and notes-to-self on getting off his heroine addiction. The fact that he OD'd in his late 20s makes it all the more tragic for me. 

There is a fair amount of original artwork, a lot of which I was totally surprised had survived (more than a few made on literal plywood). 

Anyway, what I'd say is that if you're just going to say you went and ""get the t-shirt"", you won't get much out of it. But, if you take the time to really *try* to place yourself in his shoes, as a black artist in NYC at that time, you'll get a kick out of it.",t3_103nhea,Drugs or Alcohol

Many things are highly addictive, cause physical and ""psychiatric"" harm that aren't illegal and neither should they be. Being overly combative on social media is one of those things that can cause ""psychiatric"" harm.

I'm unsure which more ""dangerous forms"" it can be made into but they should be legalized and regulated as well. The most common thing that cocaine is currently cut with is fentanyl, which is deadly in small doses and is legal and widely prescribed.

As we learned from prohibition of alcohol, and is precisely what we are seeing in Mexico, making something illegal doesn't make it go away or decrease demand. In fact it can lead to increased demand and now that money goes to gangs instead of the government. The gangs enrich themselves and cause violence, the government would use the tax profits for whatever you could imagine.

Keeping it illegal increases violence, increases deaths due to overdoses, increases social isolation, increases antisocial behavior.",t3_1birhtd,Drugs or Alcohol
4,3,">¬†No human should be allowed to tell another adult human what to do with their body

I‚Äôm actually inclined to agree, *in principle*, for an appropriately prepared, risk-aware person. However, many recovering addicts would disagree about their access to drugs which have ruined their lives. We already spectacularly fail at educating the public about alcohol, and people become socialized to think excess drinking is not only normal, but the only way adults interact socially. Many people will never understand how dangerous some drugs are, is it really ethical to allow their use?

I‚Äôm also curious what your thoughts are on the provision of services like healthcare, social work, housing, etc. for people who will have needs created by addiction to newly legal substances. Where will the resources come from, taxation of those drugs? Is that likely with our already overburdened systems? Could you even fix this with tax?

Social media is an interesting comparison, since many have said our regulatory ability greatly lags the speed of tech companies. However, it does not directly alter the chemistry of the brain and nervous system, unlike cocaine, nor does it create physical dependence.

>¬†I'm unsure which more ""dangerous forms"" it can be made into

Crack, freebase. I don‚Äôt think it would be trivial to regulate these separately when you can easily make them from cocaine.¬†

>¬†fentanyl, which is deadly in small doses and is legal and widely prescribed

It‚Äôs legal like cocaine is, which is under supervision of a physician for medical use, not freely available for recreational use like alcohol or cannabis. It would be disingenuous to suggest that cocaine and fentanyl are overly similar, given that a minute measurement error with precision equipment can cross the threshold of lethality with fentanyl.

I don‚Äôt think providing a legal means to cocaine would necessarily reduce illegal activity. The black/grey markets for cannabis in Canada are still healthy, since they outcompete legal product in price, convenience, and quality. The foreign producers of narcotics have a strong incentive to ensure their product is sold. Alcohol is an extremely different industry, and really not comparable marketwise.¬†

>¬†Keeping it illegal increases violence, increases deaths due to overdoses, increases social isolation, increases antisocial behavior

I am again inclined to agree, but I think decriminalization is a better approach. Addicts shouldn‚Äôt automatically be criminals, but the drug trade itself should be discouraged.

I'm so friggin sorry for you guys. I've been following this since Friday afternoon and hoping so much that they would find your boat. 

I'm really disappointed with the RCMP. That they weren't keeping a better eye on the water after the guy tried this once already is inexcusable in my opinion. I have lots of thoughts on how they've handled things with respect to this guy, none of them good.

You'll have a wild story to tell your grandkids some day when you're sailing on your new boat.",t3_pmau0o,Drugs or Alcohol
4,3,"No, the police weren't initially aware of the SAR operation and the stolen boat. The boat was gone for 4 days before the owner even knew it was stolen. If they hadn't been able to reach the owner (which sometimes happens if people neglect to keep the registry up to date) then the police still wouldn't know. 

It's a crazy feeling you get when you get a call that your beacon has been activated and you're not the one who activated it. It happened to us once, but it was because they contacted the wrong people (boat name was the same, but ours has a number attached i.e. Sailboat7. It was Sailboat whose beacon was activated)

I don't understand why the police weren't paying attention to the harbour traffic. Between the current hurricanes or remnants we've had, and it generally being hurricane season, the track of the 2nd stolen boat is very unusual. Even more suspicious when you consider this guy already tried this once. 

The boat AIS was on, which if you aren't a mariner means this boat was broadcasting it's location (which any member of the public can see at MarineTraffic.com). I would have thought the RCMP would have been watching every potential escape route, including by sea (watching the movement of pleasure craft). If I saw a sailboat sailing out directly in to the path of a hurricane, it would certainly raise my suspicions. 

Anyhow, it's just a bizarre situation that hasn't been covered much in the media outside of the initial arrest and escape. For example, there's been no reporting on the fact this guy stole the first boat and grounded it.

7,3,"Here is the article:

British Columbia will decriminalize possession of ‚Äúhard‚Äù drugs such as illicit fentanyl, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, in a Canadian first.

Effective Jan. 31, 2023, British Columbians 18 and older will be able to carry up to a cumulative total of 2.5 grams of these illicit substances without the risk of arrest or criminal charges. Police are not to confiscate the drugs, and there is no requirement that people found to be in possession seek treatment. The production, trafficking and exportation of these drugs will remain illegal.

Federal Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, Carolyn Bennett, made the announcement alongside her B.C. counterpart, Sheila Malcolmson, in Vancouver on Tuesday.

The change comes six years after B.C. declared a public health emergency in response to skyrocketing overdose deaths from an increasingly volatile drug supply. Close to 10,000 people have died since 2016 in B.C. alone, and advocates have put pressure on governments to re-examine drug laws that they say were intended to minimize harms but have had the opposite effect.

Fear of arrest can keep people who use drugs from seeking help, incarceration is associated with increased overdose risk, and Indigenous and racialized communities are disproportionately impacted. Criminal sanctions for personal drug use also run counter to government messaging that substance use is a health issue.

The illicit drugs covered by the new rules are opioids including heroin and fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine and MDMA ‚Äì the substances most commonly associated with toxic drug deaths, and most commonly seized by police. Police will maintain discretion to arrest and recommend charges for possessing other substances.

The new rules will not apply at elementary and secondary school premises, at licensed child care facilities, in airports, or on Canadian Coast Guard vessels and helicopter. As well, possession is still prohibited in personal vehicles or watercraft operated by a minor, regardless of whether the vehicle or watercraft is in motion. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces are subject to the Code of Service Discipline.

Decriminalization in B.C. is made possible through an exemption from federal drug laws. Under Section 56(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the minister of health can exempt from provisions of the act ‚Äúany person or class of persons ‚Ä¶ if, in the opinion of the minister, the exemption is necessary for a medical or scientific purpose or is otherwise in the public interest.‚Äù

This exemption has been used to allow for the operation of supervised drug-use sites and to conduct research or clinical trials that involve controlled substances. More recently, it permitted pharmacists to prescribe, sell and transfer prescriptions for controlled substances so people with substance-use disorders could continue to get medications during the pandemic.

B.C.‚Äôs exemption expires on Jan. 31, 2026, or the date when it is revoked or replaced by another exemption ‚Äì whichever comes first.

B.C. formally submitted its application to Health Canada seeking an exemption in November. It had sought a cumulative threshold of 4.5 grams, saying that amount would likely accommodate a multi-day supply and some sharing for many people who use drugs.

Ms. Malcolmson told reporters in April that Ottawa was considering the application with a lower threshold. Critics said a lower threshold failed to account for illicit fentanyl driving up opioid tolerances, and the fact that some drug users purchase and hold small amounts of drugs for others.

Health Canada‚Äôs position is that the lower threshold balances public health and public safety, despite there being limited research on threshold limits.",t3_v1xnkm,Drugs or Alcohol

Cocaine use is being blamed for the death in police custody of a well-known restaurateur more than a year ago.

The province‚Äôs police watchdog ‚Äî the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba ‚Äî concluded on Wednesday that George Simeonidis Jr., the owner of Santa Lucia Pizza on Corydon Avenue, died on Nov. 4, 2021, because of cocaine intoxication and not because of anything Winnipeg police officers did or didn‚Äôt do.

‚ÄúThe circumstances of this incident represents another tragic example of the illicit use of drugs such as cocaine,‚Äù IIU civilian director Zane Tessler said in the report released Wednesday.

 
The IIU concluded on Wednesday that George Simeonidis Jr. died on Nov. 4, 2021 because of cocaine intoxication.
‚ÄúBased on the circumstances, and in consideration of all of the available information, particularly the eyewitness accounts, video footage and medical opinions and findings, there is nothing to support a conclusion that there is any level of contribution by any police officer to the cause of (Simeonidis‚Äô) death, either by action or inaction.‚Äù

Tessler said the matter is now closed.

Police said the 45-year-old man was walking in and out of Osborne Street traffic near the intersection of River Avenue just after 7 p.m.

Officers were forced to tackle and handcuff him when he tried walking into traffic again instead of allowing paramedics to examine him.

While paramedics were moving him to a stretcher, he stopped breathing and they immediately began CPR.

Simeonidis was rushed to St. Boniface Hospital in critical condition, and was pronounced dead a short time later.

An autopsy report ‚Äî not received by the IIU until 361 days after Simeonidis‚Äô death ‚Äî said he died because of cocaine intoxication, with an enlarged heart being a contributing factor.

There would be less harms if it was legalized, properly (heavily) regulated, and taxed.

Instead of pretending that the drug laws are working, we could provide a safer way to obtain and use the substance that you want, while doing good quality research on it and providing people with education about the risks associated with use.

But then people could go to a store and know exactly what they're buying and how much. Informed decisions could be made.",t3_104etop,Drugs or Alcohol
7,3,"We agree on that point.

The point I'm making is that it is clear that despite significant efforts to control the distribution and use of cocaine, it remains widely available and is almost always cut with other dangerous substances, including fentanyl. These additives can significantly increase the risks associated with using the drug, as users are often unaware of their presence and therefore unable to make informed decisions about their use.

While it is important to recognize that cocaine use and abuse can have negative consequences, due to the fact that the controls are largely a failure, we should have implemented alternative approaches long ago. Regulation and quality control would be more effective at protecting individuals from the potentially harmful effects of adulterated drugs, not to mention secondary benefits of reduced burden on the justice system, taxation, etc.",t3_104etop,Drugs or Alcohol

7,3,"I'm of the opinion that all substances (and all forms of sex work for that matter) should be legalized.

I don't know of any good arguments against being able to ingest whatever substance you want in your body so long as you are not harming anyone else.

It's just a fact of life that a lot of people are using all kinds of drugs whether they are legal or illegal. The black market makes acquiring these drugs less safe. You have to go meet someone you might not know in possibly an unsafe location.

You have to hope you're buying what you actually want. You have to hope it's not adulterated with anything else. (Please get your drugs tested before consuming)

So if we were to legalize these substances and regulate them, then we could eliminate a lot of shame and stigma. You would know exactly what you're buying and how much. It's safer that way. If I want to ingest a substance that is cardiotoxic, then I should be allowed to do that.

Certain substances have been made illegal for political reasons to oppress minority populations. They are not illegal because they're unhealthy. If that were the case, then alcohol would be illegal, but look how poorly that went during the Prohibition Era. There were far more increased harms due to bootlegged, toxic alcohols being sold to people on the black market.

I'm of the opinion that we should have open and honest conversations about these topics. For example, there are actually a lot of benefits to substance use that are rarely mentioned, if ever.

When it comes to substances (or anything really) a person has to ask themselves why they are taking the substance, what are they getting out of it, and what their relationship to the substance is.

The vast majority of people who use substances use casually, socially, or habitually, but it doesn't interrupt their responsibilities and activities of daily living. It's a small percentage that develop a problematic substance use disorder and even then it's too simplistic to blame the person or drugs. You have to look at their life as a whole, their living situation, the environment they grew up in, and if they have experienced trauma in their life.

While I bet you could see the logic in this argument, I suspect you'd remember that we can't really stop people from using alcohol no matter how hard we try. History has shown that attempts to do so just lead to more crime and more dangerous product. 

There's an old adage called ""the dose makes the poison"" and applies to just about everything in the context of recreational substances. But even if we assume it's true that there's no safe level, trying to enforce that kind of control would require a level of policing that borders on a police state, and let's be honest, do we really want to go there? As it stands right now we have the worst of both worlds with high usage of adulterated drugs, criminal enterprises flourishing, high stigma, and low education.

8,3,"The ""*Safer supply*"" which is already in use (Dilaudid, hydromorphone) are medications both covered by ""FairPharma"" - which is a means tested program designed so that those who could not afford their medications are given generic alternatives covered in many cases by the BC Government. So for many addicts, especially those which are not ""functioning addicts"" (quotations because I have yet to meet a ""functional"" heroin addict) who are able to hold down jobs, the program is already free of charge. 

Using the model of safer supply which we have already established, I find it hard to believe that any expansion of the program to include clean versions of class A street narcotics which that market desires wouldn't include the same basic principles of low barrier financial access.

If such a program were to be implemented - safer supply of clean ""heroin"" as an example - we would instantaneously create new social problems *if* the program was setup as a free-for-all. 

Opiates require an ever increasing dose to experience the desired effect as they build up in the liver, so if safer supply is designed to eliminate the toxic drug supply, an addict just using ""heroin"" would need to be supplied with their *declared desired amount*. This means that either the safer supply doctor or pharmacist, and dispensary/pharmacy would need to be accessible 24/7, as well as staffed to the point where the addict can access the safer supply doctor/pharmacist *and* dispensary/pharmacy quicker and more conveniently than the black market already offers. This would also mean accepting that the reality of heroin addiction requires that the average addict access this program, start to finish, multiple times each day. 

Alternatively, the program could also be structured to give the addict a supply of a day's worth or more - an act which would be incredibly irresponsible, if not negligent considering everything we know about addiction as well as the evidence of how overdoses spike after midnight on the last Wednesday of each month. 

The clean ""heroin"" would also need to be able to compete with the toxic supply in terms of potency, whether that requires an increased dosage, more frequent usage, or using another substance such as fentanyl. Many addicts are not only addicted to one thing. In fact, many are addicted to to drugs which the physician and pharmaceutical community *know* to be adverse combinations - such as ""heroin"" and ""crack"", or ""coke"" and bennies.

There is also the issue of what prolonged usage does to the body. Beyond the well-documented brain damage that comes with heroin usage, there is also the specific damage which comes from the most common mode of delivery - intravenously. The longer an addict uses this way, the less ability they have to continue due to collapsed veins, inevitably leading to the addict fixing in areas which are even more incredibly dangerous than regular use - places which no medical professional could agree with using ""safely"".

I also find it hard to believe that offering addicts another reason to flock to the DTES in the form of expanded, free, safer supply, combined with the multitude of other benefits already offered, with more in the works, that such a program implemented *only* in BC, or Vancouver wouldn't produce a larger population of addicts looking to enroll in the program. 

There are a whole bunch of valid concerns surrounding this concept that have absolutely nothing to do with the question of the *morality* of drug use or financially supporting addiction through taxpayer funding. 

From the very basic ethical barrier of ""do no harm"" for healthcare professionals being theoretically asked to prescribe toxic amounts or combinations to their patients under threat of the patient accessing the black market, to the concrete issues of funding a parallel healthcare system for addicts that is better staffed and more efficient than what the tax-paying, law-abiding citizens are offered, the idealistic way in which the realities of addiction are ignored is frustrating.

Tl;Dr - There are valid concerns about the cost, effectiveness and consequences of an expanded Government safer supply program including clean class A street narcotics beyond the question of morality surrounding drug use. Basing policy decisions on idealistic aspirations as opposed to acknowledgement of the realities of the nature of addiction cannot possibly lead to success.",t3_14nypl1,Drugs or Alcohol

The issue with making stuff like this available recreationally is that this is a dopamine hijacking drug where tolerance  is increased and so in order to get to the effective dose (where you feel effects you want to feel, particularly the euphoria feeling), you have to creep closer and closer and closer to the lethal dose and the gap is small.

The reason I argue for safe supply is because so many people are dying of overdose because they can't control what or how much they're taking due to drugs on the street being sold as something they're not (for examples of this you can check out @getyourdrugstested on instagram). No one is using potentially contaminated drugs because they want to.

Ugly, but society still had improved health. Failure to help leftover alcoholics was a lack of political will, not a question of legalization vs. prohibition.

>it fuelled a huge increase in gangs and organized crime much like drug prohibition is doing right

Link between rises in organized crime and the Prohibition is debated by scholars. America had no standards for crime statistics for most of the Prohibition, and cities that did maintain stats saw contrasting results.

Even if the data were available, modern socioeconomic studies cannot provide accurate models for understanding increases and decreases in crime. Every popular theory of the last 30 years just got wiped by America's recent post-COVID increase in violent crime.

>and legal means we can tax and regulate it to minimize harms vs endsless money pit the police are in failing to stop it

No obvious link between legalization + taxation and reducing social harms, especially with drug addiction.

* Both Switzerland and Portugal drastically decreased addiction while maintaining stricter policing than BC.
* Most of the Muslim world manages lower levels of addiction without any liberalization (de-criminalization, legalization, whatever).

8,3,"It sounds like you have internalized a number of narratives. I have family who've had trouble with stimulants, and, basically, you have to want to quit. I know that sounds stupid, but if you don't want to quit, you won't, especially because you can't, like go to some addiction treatment center out on, gosh, it's on the road to Chilliwack Lake, iirc, there is one. Out in the middle of nowyhere, so even if you wanted to party, you're not walking 20km into Chilliwack to score.

There is very little evidence that AA/NA style programs work, family members tried those. The quitting for one came from residential treatment and the threat of homelessness, and the other from 2 overdoses.

Since cocaine does not really have any withdrawal syndrome, take the cocaine you have and throw it out.  Delete whatever contact information you have for your source, and if it is an acquaintance, stop hanging around them.

You can indulge in lots of therapeutic role-play (talking about childhood trauma, ""triggers"" etc. is very much in vogue) but ultimately, you have found the button cocaine hits, and plenty of people find this even without childhood trauma, so that is a bit of a red herring. People do stimulants because they like stimulation.

Generally, you could look at your diet: most of the population doesn't get enough choline, protein, etc.  Eat 4 eggs a day, see what it does.  Look for biochemical notions, rather than sociological ones: fundamentally it is not metaphysical ""childhood trauma"" causing you to use cocaine, it is the physiological reaction you have to it, along with what it does for you: let's you do more work in a short span of time.

IF you find you need stimulants to handle your workload, you could also try getting dexedrine or adderall, which are not really GOOD to use, but at least you would get pure material.

Beware of people selling you therapy that has the goal of ""unpacking"" some nebulous childhood issues, that is basically psycchoanalysis, which doesnt do much, it's why psychiatry switched to prescribing medications, not that they do much either.  You fundamentally have to interrupt hte behaviuor you want to stop, the repetitive, daily use of cocaine, it is that simple.  Whatever narrative you end up using to do that might be helpful, but it can also make you focus more on ""resolving the narrative' rather than simply doing something else with youreslf.

Wellbutrin (Buproprion) is an antidepressant that acts as a stimulant. This is why it can help people quit smoking and lose weight. 

Dexedrine has been prescribed to people with stimulant substance use disorder by addiction doctors. It's been showing promising effects in people as their cravings are reduced. This has led to some studies and some estimates that nearly 70% of stimulant users are actually self medicating their adhd.

You've described exactly the words I didn't know I needed, i.e., figure out who you are as the foundation for setting boundaries. Pretty eye opening.",t3_u0b9xh,Drugs or Alcohol
8,3,">  Boundaries come with knowing who you are, your identity and that does require a therapist so you can finally learn how to speak-up-for-yourself.

I see all sorts of people saying this, but I don't see any evidence it works, for much of anything. You can go to a therapist for years and go 'I was good this week I didn't binge eat.' ""I was bad, I binge ate!' And the therapist asks ""How did that make you feel?""

All of this addict-style externalization---if you are at a party where people are doing cocaine, you have two options: just don't do any, or leave and don't go to those sorts of parties. If it is a partner, I dunno if she has said that her partner uses cocaine, from what I got he's an alcoholic, but in the film industry, which is part of why she thinks it's easy to buy cocaine.

Like, I don't hang around film industry ppl in IATSE who snort cocaine to do 14 hour shifts or whatever they do, so even buying cocaine would be a challenge for me.  There are a lot of narratives here in her writing, ""it's so easy to buy drugs in Vancouver,"" well, yeah, you can go to main and hastings and take your chances, but I doubt she means that.

I would have trouble buying cocaine, even if I asked my drug using friends because most of them are into psychedelics, MDMA, weed, craft beer.  It's a certain sort of crowd she's hanging around, and she takes that for ""typical.""  I know the type.

The person she has to say NO to is herself.  She needs to accept that she is doing this to herself. Her childhood is not doing it to her. Her boyfriend is not doing it to her. She's doing it to herself. So as I said, if she can't be around cocaine, and her boyfriend is using, she has a very difficult choice to make. If he's not using, just a degenerate film industry alcoholic, well, that probably means she is going to be around people who use cocaine if she is around him, because they are degenerates who think ""adulting"" is snorting cocaine to stay awake between takes. I had a buddy YEARS ago who had an in with IATSE due to family, and he just couldn't fucking stand being around coke sniffing degenerates.

So there are, as I said elsewhere, a lot of responsibility-denying narratives. You are 100% responsible for who you spend time with. You are 100% responsible for every line you snort.

Like, I notice I'm pretty much the only one who told her to throw the cocaine out and stop associating with anyone who uses. It's that simple.  But until you want to do those things, you won't.  That's how my relatives who had problems ended up not using: they wanted to stop using, so they did, which meant never having cocaine around and enver hanging out with their partying friends. Thankfully neither of them ever built a ""life"" with a partier, they always understood partying was something you did with other party-people, you don't fucking take them home with you.",t3_u0b9xh,Drugs or Alcohol

9,3,"Complex. I have a pretty dynamic relationship with drugs & alcohol. Growing up I abused them all. Especially psychedelics. Loved them. Got a little older and I started to have some friends die. Whether it was the guy whose Mustang got airborne when he was coked up or it was the guy who killed himself while on a messy cocktail I still didn't clue in. Grew up with a Dad who was an extreme alcoholic and I didn't realize growing up that life didnt have to include addiction. Quite a few people I grew up with got lost with acid use that turned into addiction to other chemicals. Shells of who they should have become. 

Into my 20s and early 30s I went hard on booze, coke, weed and MDMA. Lost a lot of friends and wronged a lot of people because I was basically a shithead with very few redeeming qualities. Just wanted to party and very rarely made good decisions about my life and spent a lot of time negatively impacting others. Thankfully, always stayed away from the real shitty drugs like meth or fent, but my trajectory was not a positive one. 

It took my meeting a beautiful woman whom I didn't want to let down and having kids with her to clean me up. Got an education. A battle I didn't know I could win. In hindsight, I've been very fortunate. I now occasionally have a beer on a hot summer day, or have the occasional hoot to chill. Glad I can control it now, because for years I didn't have any. Now in my forties with lots of healthy habits, a good job and a great family. Some current friends don't understand why I'm not down to go for beers, but I would rather spend time ""doing"" something, opposed to sitting and increasing the likelihood of me being a twat. Absolutely no drugs these days outside of the odd hoot to chill. 

I'm all for recreational drug use and I have a lot of empathy for addicts of any sort. It's a slippery slope and if you have pre-exisiting traumas there's a real fine line between help and harm. My experiences with drugs and addiction have made me a better person, but goddamn I wish I had some of those years back that I fucked away on drugs and booze. Moderation just wasn't my thing. 

Our culture normalizes alcohol use, which I don't understand. I've seen booze do more damage than any other drug. And sugar - no one talks about that being a drug, but the folks who have to have a slurpee or down a 2L of Pepsi and watch their blood sugar might tell you otherwise. A few years ago I spent months visiting my Dad in the ICU (pancreatitis from the booze) and it was full of diabetics and alcoholics. The nurses all said that was pretty normal. The two most regulated and readily available ""drugs"" causing all of that. Go figure. 

I didn't realize it until I cleaned up a bit, but there's a lot of value in having a clear head from good food, exercise and nature. If you're going to do them drugs, maybe make sure you've got some balance with those things. And if you see someone nodding off on the corner, please just remember that there's a real good chance it's happening because something happened to that person and the drugs help make that thing(s) more bearable.",t3_xb6pti,Drugs or Alcohol
9,3,"City Paramedic. Hi.

I've watched people overdose on fentanyl and could bring most of them back when we're early enough. I've tried rationalizing with people on meth in handcuffs while we're waiting in the hallways at Foothills. I'm tired of trying to reason with people so drunk that they just make gutteral yells and flail their fists in response. College friends that call us to take their drunk friend away because ""she's killing the vibe"". 

I can get behind the use of medical cannabis for chronic pain and anxiety issues and a fun shot of rye at the bar or for a night cap. Pain management where tramadol and morphine don't work anymore.

What bothers me is when people think they're so far gone that they're done trying to find themselves anymore, or when the kid at 16 tried something for the first and last time. Homeless people that are stuck begging for money instead of having more access to government care programs to work or have a safe place to sleep. The Alpha House, DI, and Chumir are fantastic until a client gets thrown out for the 3rd time.

My relationship with drugs is my relationship with the city. I think everything should be legalized and monitored so less people are hurt by street drugs and uncontrolled medications. Less people would be afraid to tell us what drugs they took if they weren't worried about getting charged on top of a crisis. But that's a pipe dream in Calgary, since illegal access to homemade meds will always be a thing and everyone has a friend with access to Vyvance and T4's or better (worse?). The best we can do is package, transport, and keep trying to connect people to city lifelines. 

Me? I drink socially but past that I'm not interested in smoking, vaping, or any kind of mind-altering meds. Honestly, I need my cardio and mind to be sharp on shift and some of that stuff slows me down the next day. Those THC drinks are pretty nice though, I've watched them help my family members out with their fibromyalgia. I don't think it kills the pain, it just makes them not care about it as much.",t3_xb6pti,Drugs or Alcohol

9,3,"OP, just to be specific to  (my own) particularities of what you asked. My wife and I moved here from the east coast with two young children when I began grad school about eight years ago. We were both extremely young parents, but were conscious and fearful of resenting our kids if we ""missed"" our youth. Fortunately, we were always able to find responsible pockets of time, where our kids were in good care and we could have a little fun before snapping back to normalcy.

Now, we are homeowners and fairly upper middle class and this is the weird shift I've noticed, personally: years ago, especially when we first moved, we caught sideways looks everywhere we went, I imagine due to our age, tattoos and piercings, as if we were street urchins who abducted two kids who wandered into the east side. Fellow parents and school administrators were absolutely rotten to us and made outlandish claims about us and almost always they came back to the fact they thought that we were drug addicts, despite not knowing us.

The circumstances are now different that we make better money and live in a vastly nicer neighborhood, plus have gotten to know more people through work, school, the community. However, what astonishes both me and my wife, is how truly insane the upper and upper middle class of this city can be. Yes, there is an obvious opiate crisis playing all out over the city, but it's often playing out in the most stereotypical, made-for-TV way imaginable. My wife is a professional tattooist and I work in OG&P, yet both of us agree in terms of co-workers and clientele, no one tops the irresponsible consumption of some of the affluent parents we come into contact with.

There's a girl both in my daughter's school and that she has played rep hockey with for four years; she is forbidden to ever go into a car if said girl's mother is driving. We give our children very, very few rules, especially of this kind, and we were incredibly serious when we told her this. My wife and I are legitimately scared this woman is going to kill someone - herself, her children or someone else - while messed up percs, Xanax and prosecco. Her husband, a very well-paid executive with a major national media company is the ""responsible"" one and he is an insatiable, erratic cokehead. They're the most vivid example in ""our circle"", but they're sadly a dime a dozen here. It's amazing how insecure I used to feel as a parent about my limited, constrained drug use, seeing how these freaks operate and jeopardize their own children and others around them.",t3_xb6pti,Drugs or Alcohol

Indirect relationship: My sister (who doesn't fit the stereotype at all) has recently come out as a crack addict for the last year and a half. It's been a rough couple months in terms of that, but she's doing better. 

I've had 2 uncles commit suicide possibly related to drug use/severe mental health issues. Opoid addiction and chronic pain are common in my family. Along with mental health issues related to depression, anxiety, borderline personality, and schizophrenia. 

I have a new friend group that uses all sorts of party drugs. MDMA, ket, vyvance (? Idk what it is), coke, etc. I don't partake but have witnessed them on it. Not a huge fan. Not a huge fan of parties either though so ü§∑

I've helped stabilize a homeless guy OD'ing on fentanyl til the ambulance got there. that was scary to see what someone would do to themselves to get away from their suffering. 

What I use: cannabis (daily almost), psychedelics (shrooms, acid - maybe 2-3 times/year. Tried microdosing, didn't like it). Daily coffee drinker. 1-2x/month alcohol drinker (maybe 3-4 drinks max)

why: cannabis: it's definitely a habit now. but I really enjoy the flow state it puts me in for various activities, or deep thinking. it's a fine line of balancing my issues with it vs overdoing it and having a bad time but I'm learning to manage it. I also use it for parties rather than drinking, and love smoking in nature. it has a spiritual component for me.

psychedelics: mushrooms, and a ""bad"" trip at that, is what turned me from a 5 years suicidal daily (as in resisting throwing myself in front of the train on my way to uni), depressed, anxious, hating my life mess, to where I am now (a huge new friend group, building 2 businesses, involved in hobbies, creating side hustles, mostly loving life just get anxious sometimes). I've had some of the most incredibly deep, wondrous, spiritual, life changing experiences on psychs. I've had bad trips of course, but I've been able to manage and it takes a bit to integrate, but there's always something to learn from them. 

as someone who's had counselling/therapy blow up in my face and end up more traumatizing than not having it - psychedelics have done more for me than any conventional treatment. I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for mushrooms.

Yes, I am aware of the risk of psych use with potential for schizophrenia. Within my spiritual framework I have.... ""addressed"" isn't the right word but idk what else to say, but I've addressed it. I could probably be diagnosed as it based on my day to day experiences. But it's not a problem, quite the opposite. It would be a lot to explain more than this so I'll leave it here. 

I do, on occasion, take psychs for fun. it always becomes spiritual or life changing, but it's also fun too.

I don't recommend or suggest going off pharmaceuticals and taking psychs. this is just my experience.

in regards to other drugs; I'm not against them. just not a fan and the risk is too much for many of them. plus seeing people I know on them deters me. I would maybe try MDMA if I did the appropriate prep. I'm interested in ayahuasca and dmt. I also find party drugs to be more common among middle/upper class. All of my lower class friends like myself smoke cannabis. I don't know many who take psychs besides family members and my partner.

Just like insulin doesn't ""cure"" diabetes, whatever pharma has thrown at depression doesn't ""cure"" depression, it just attempts to manage symptoms and alter mood. 

I think we have a societal problem in how we view pain. Most people view pain as a negative that must be avoided at all costs, when really, pain is information that is absolutely integral for us to live. Say you sprain your ankle. Your body has a handy device (pain) that is able to communicate how much weight, if any, you can put on your foot. We should be thankful for this information.

Depression, could be viewed as brain pain and has been a part of the human experience through all recorded history. It's like an app the brain runs when things are getting kind of messed up in people's lives. It's *designed*  to lower our levels and cause us to contemplate and consider things and change what needs to be changed. But if the ""cure"" is to find some happy drug cocktail which allows us to stay in our miserable rut, nothing changes, does it. And the pain is wasted and ignored.",t3_xb6pti,Drugs or Alcohol

* Test or have your battery tested regularly. If your engine is cranking more slowly than it used to, your battery may be on its way out. Once it gets colder outside, it may no longer be able to start the engine at all. Don't wait until that point to replace your battery, or you may end up getting stranded.
* Change your oil on the manufacturer's recommended severe service schedule, and use full synthetic oil, especially if you frequently have to start your car in the cold without it being plugged in. Synthetic oil increases in viscosity much less in cold temperatures - when using conventional oil at extreme temperatures, even if your engine manages to start, it may be getting almost no lubrication until the engine warms up.
* It's generally not necessary to leave your engine running for more than a few minutes before driving, even in the coldest temperatures. Just drive gently for the first bit while it is still warming up. Many newer vehicles don't produce much heat at idle speeds, and idling the engine to warm it up only increases the length of time it runs while cold, which increases the amount of water and fuel that gets into your oil, which reduces its lubricating ability. You may think it is helping your engine, but may actually be hurting it, and wasting a significant amount of fuel in the process.",t3_zmwnfe,Drugs or Alcohol

Many who use daily use it for this reason, and even have a medicinal cannabis license. Granted I'm not saying this is everybody, but I'm focusing on this to prove a point.

Now if you want to venture into the neurological science about how all levels of drugs affect the brain, than that's a whole next level conversation that goes far beyond anything your prepared for. 

Society is simply cracking down on everyone who feels the need to self medicate to counter the mentality ""but life is too hard"". 

You closed by supporting my early comment. Binge use increases your tolerance but DOESN'T make it safer nor better. This is solely about those who abuse the use of self medicating. It's a false perception to say something is safer because it is there go to habit to cope with their ""tough hard life"" and they refuse to accept they are contributing to the bigger problem.

Right now a lot of people are being fined for being impaired when they're actually not impaired. The current swab test does not accurately detect impairment because it cannot detect the compound that lets you know you're impaired. There is a new breathalyzer device being developed called Cannabix that does accurately detect the impairment molecule. I can only speak for myself on this, but I can confidently say I will have no issues with any sort of crack down on impaired driving via cannabis when/if this technology is adopted because it is actually accurate.

2,4,"I‚Äôm in my mid 40s and grew up around. I played there all my childhood and we always looked in the grass for syringes before sitting/lying/playing there. I witnessed more than my share of weird shits over the years. Then the village happened and it was a great thing for the gay community. It also brought the first wave of gentrification. 

Poor people were pushed est, but there was still room for the descendants of ‚ÄúLe faubourg √† m‚Äôlasse‚Äù, and the safety it gave to the gay community was a necessity, and one of the great thing that happened to the neighborhood.

And then 10-15 years ago started the new French wave. Fed up of the Plateau and rising prices, the settled in droves, putting more pressure on the historically poor people move est. Then 5-8 years ago, anglophones number started going up. Plates from Ontario and New-York. Not just around the village, but in all the neighborhoods. The pressure to move est continued, but even the areas around Frontenac and Hochelaga were being gentrified. At the same time Airbnb, and house flippers continued chasing the population away. 

But there was nowhere else to go when you are dirt poor. So you stay with friends, family and drug friends. Then the pandemic broke those links and people ended up in the streets. 

Now, where do mentally Ill people go? What do you do when you‚Äôve been cast away from your homes? There used to be ‚Äúcrack houses‚Äù every few other streets, male and female prostitutes splitting saint-catherine and Ontario. Now those people are still alive, they just don‚Äôt have a roof or people from their network around anymore. 

And now the situation has reverted. The balance that somewhat existed in the 2000-2018 era gave way to the current situation that gets worst by the year. Not as bad as the nineties, (Hells angels vs rock machines, skinheads and Co.)but still pretty bad. It‚Äôs sad. We need to invest again in the communal kitchens, make sure people can have a roof and accept that addicts will always be there. Better to reduce the harm than fight them. These people have as much right as we do to live in this city. 

If we chase them away from their houses, we should really advocate for serious investments in social housing. Every house flipped should contribute. Every new buyers who move in a historically rental neighbourhood should pay an extra for public/low income housing.

It's good to be able to talk about it, though. I don't really have anyone to talk about it now, not at home at least; it's not a lack of care but being aware of how the people I live with would react to my position and telling, then afterwards what they would almost certainly say, and it would have only the net effect of taking on my feelings invalidated and being told to 'think about something else', again, not impolitely, but it might as well be from a prewritten script at this point.

Its a lot closer to even than you think.  Its a chain effect from everyone having main character syndrome.  Pedestrians take up the time allocated for motorists, so then on the next change pedestrians don't get their turn and by the time the motorists clear, they don't get their turn, so take up the time waiting for motorists, who then rush the yellow and the cycle repeats and keeps building.  You have this going on throughout every intersection in downtown.

>On an unrelated note, who is responsible for congestion on highways? And what steps should we take to improve traffic flow?

Very different problem.  Investment in highways and access to downtown in general hasn't kept up with population growth for like 60 years.  You have infrastructure like the Gardiner that was EOL 15 years ago.

So start with actually replacing infrastructure as its going to expire.  That means major capital investments into things like rebuilding the Gardiner.

Then the easiest thing to do is look at expanding work from home incentives so that you have much less need to actually go downtown in the first place.  During COVID it was very easy to get where you needed to and I don't remember congestion being an issue.  Lockdown isn't a solution, but a big chunk of the jobs that are done downtown, like 90%+ of office work, can be done remotely.  So instead of encouraging companies to open up, I'd be doing everything in my power to get them to close their offices permanently.  A tax deduction aimed at businesses based on how much less traffic they're creating would be a great start. 

If that wasn't reducing use of the highways enough, then we can start to get punitive.  Special taxes for companies that have offices in downtown Toronto, for work that can be done remotely, for companies with more than 50 employees or contractors.

Long term, and this is related to the above point, if we're going to rely on immigration at the levels we have, then we need to give strong incentives for people to locate in areas that aren't Toronto and Vancouver.  Its the same for people moving cities within Canada.  Its not sustainable for 2 cities to absorb 50% of all immigrants, in addition to the people moving from other parts of Canada to those cities.  

The biggest reason people move to Toronto and Vancouver from other parts of Canada is economic opportunity.  So encouraging remote work means we can move a lot of jobs that would force people to move from Kapuskasing to Toronto, back to Kapuskasing.  

If that doesn't relieve the stress in the GTA enough, maybe we start to look at introducing more incentive programs for people to set up their family outside of the GTA, and expanding access to services and programs immigrants leverage in smaller communities, while limiting their growth in Toronto and Vancouver.

It really depends how aggressive you want to be in addressing the problem.",t3_1c7sl3j,Drugs or Alcohol

3,4,"> How? The city already tried ""cracking down"" on Uber drivers, and that didn't go very well.

> That's a provincial issue, not municipal.

Uber pays commission. They could make it so it pays a projected hourly wage equivalent to how long it takes to deliver each one. Ie a 15 min delivery could pay min wage equivalent divided by 4.

IMGs who train in family medicine will ultimately realize what a shit show it is being a GP in Canada/NS and then say, well, when I'm done my training, I will not set up a practice and just work in the hospital as an ER doc or a hospitalist. Or do some private cosmetic care and make rich women look young. Or maybe help out surgeons in surgery and make hourly pay with no overhead.

And trying to convince someone from another province to engage in this and also putting salt in the wound by asking him or her to make more in Ontario and Alberta? And pay less tax?

4,4,"So, we do have some semblance of government paid salaries in NS already. There is one for GPs called an APP( to this day I never found out what it stands for!). You get a monthly salary and there is also sick pay! I was actually on APP when I first started working in NS in 2020. Just as a transition year to help me get started, get to know rural complex NS patients and get my feet wet. 

Initially, NSH told me I would get a 6 month APP. I fought hard to get it extended to a year.

Sadly though? The APP DOES NOT include your costs for overhead- and that was especially challenging for myself and other GP who ran the whole damn show, with a little bit of assistance from NSH.

It was an extremely satisfying salary for me! the key word is me. Others may not be happy with it for many reasons.

And well, when you couple in overhead costs? I can see why many GPs opt for non salary.

However, if we could opt for a government salary? with some benefits thrown in( like others who work for the feds/province)? And the government takes care of overhead> 

  
OH MY LORD!!!! you would definitely see some huge passionate interest in this.

And if doctors don't like this model? fine...continue with your own thang...

By the way, I pleaded with NSH to extend my APP because I was truly happy with it and somewhat treading water trying to help run the practice. NSH said no. I had to go back on salary and that's when the proverbial shit started to hit the fan for me. I started to drown more and more in debt and I refused to just make my practice a damn conveyor belt with patients quickly coming in my office and leaving so I could make enough money to just pay the lights and staff and paper and some kids toys....",t3_1blowq6,Drugs or Alcohol

 So I shocked many of my fellow residents who thought I was sniffing glue in Saskatoon( where I did my training) when I switched to FAmily Medicine

The second round will get filled hopefully in all parts of Canada- as a Canadian, I want this.

4,4,"Hehe.. you‚Äôre saying the quiet unsaid part amongst GPs out loud.. shhhhhh

But yes, you make valid points.

As a follow up?

This is extremely unpopular to bring up  amongst many in NS but we do have very high rates of chronic conditions that can be avoided/ prevented.

From my experience? No matter how much I try to educate about lifestyle. People don‚Äôt listen.

Not every Diabetic is genetic/family history related. Not every hypertensive is Genetic/ family history related. Not every hypercholesterolemia is family history related.
MI.. cancer.. strokes.. You name it.

And lifestyle is very linked to these conditions.

We could save a lot of money and heartache for people and health care system by just being more careful..

But this is a very very complex area. healthy living is keyed in to prices/ earning power/ education.  Blah blah blah

4,4,"I agree with this comment Embarrassed. I know many GPs who will rant against inflated specialist pay behind closed doors and just paint them in an extremely negative light. There are actually specialists who feel that GPs should be paid more- many of them are very supportive of our plight. Haha, in fact, we really help them make money because of our referrals! 

But in all seriousness?  It's not even about more pay. Several provinces have made major strides in paying GPs more- in fact, NS has a decent pay model now for us.

The more serious issue is that some of us would love to have other business/financial aspects of family medicine taken over by NSH. Of course....caveat....it's NSH. Hence why some GPs love taking care of things on their own. 

But from my perspective? In terms of what I do and how NSH looks after me? I'm somewhat pleased. There is room for improvement and I will be meeting with the powers to be to make changes for the clinic where I work. But overall, I see some positives.",t3_1blowq6,Drugs or Alcohol
4,4,"Yep,..I think in Norway or Sweden or one of those cool countries, they have primary clinic models for the Norweigan GPs where yes- you come in and work, do your thing. You get a salary, No need to worry about overhead. You get a salary. And.....benefits- paid sick leave, paid parental leave, paid education leave, other benefits.

Just like any federal or provincial government employee.

If a GP wants to make 600,000 a year? Go ahead- if that allows him to have a certain lifestyle, fine. I do not resent him one bit for working like a machine/dog to achieve this- though I do have to wonder about quality of care though, lol.

He can operate as a non government employee- what they call independent contractors. In Canada, a good number of GPs are independent contractors. We bill the government for our services but are not employees.

But a lot of us don't mind being government employees...as long as the government knows what they're doing.....LOL LOL....hence why some doctors don't like being employees.

4,4,"Haha...ahh, well thanks.

Hmm, NS truly needs to increase the residency seats when CBU starts graduating the medical students! We don't want a potential dumpster fire of a situation happening where we have these grads and there are no spots for them in the province.

If we lose them to other provinces? They may not come back.

There are 5 families I know of with children who are Dal grads and couldn't match in the province because of lack of spots. All the kids ended up in other provinces, finished their training and are not coming back to practice. The grass can be greener on the other side and some decided to just continue lying on that grass.

The problem with trying to increase the number of residency spots is funding and mentors/teachers/professors to train the residents- huge obstacle in Canada nation wide and of course in NS.

But funding and the number of trainers/mentors can be increased by putting even more money into health care/education and then making it more attractive for physicians to be engaged in teaching( like proper proper compensation)

But this is truly a complex area and I'm not bright enough to know all the intricacies and obstacles.

However, I'll tell you a dirty little secret. Canada trains many foreign qualified physicans from very rich countries like Saudi/UAE/Kuwait/Bahrain!! they are trained in a certain specialty for a number of years and then they go back home. Their governments pay HUGE dollar to the medical schools/ health ministries for the training for their doctors. I don't know if the mentors/ physician teachers get extra compensation or how that works.

But see what extra money can do? It can help train Saudis!!!

So, hmmm...just simple math or logic here- increase funding to medical schools/residency programmes/teachers and lets create more spots for Canadian grads and internationally trained graduates who want to practice medicine .

It can be done.",t3_1blowq6,Drugs or Alcohol

5,4,"Quite the list!

1. Roofing shingles- if they are worn, faded and the edges are curling up then yes need to do, if not then you can probably delay them.
2. Replace siding- all of it or a few pieces here and there? Is it dirty and could benefit from a power sprayer going over it with a bit of soap? 
3. Thermostats- 11!!!??? I can't see a 3 bedroom with a basement having this many thermostats. I'm hazarding a guess you should have no more than 2 and that would be a couple hundred for each SMART thermostat and then whatever the cost for someone to wire it up. Find out what type of furnace you have as not all newer thermostats work with all types of furnaces.
4. Paint- you can do this yourself, look for paint sales in your area. Multiply the height and width of your wall to get the basic area and don't forget to get some painters tape to help with clean lines. It is not the most fun job in the world to paint but you can watch YouTube videos that can show you the basics.
5. HRV system- maybe have an inspection first and see how much life is left in it.
6. Replace door- is it broken or you just don't like it? The door could be up to $1000 depending on what you are choosing but if you are replacing the door and frame then this is much more expensive. Maybe paint the door to change it up?
7. Pest Control- start with traps for both and do a walk around the house looking for cracks it holes the rats can get in from. If it is a big hole then fill it with copper steel wool and outdoor caulking (caulking comes in different colours to) or expanding foam.
8.Replacing washer/dryer- are they not working well? Or just un-attractive. If you have the money wait for local sales. (Best time for sales seems to Black Froday with Boxing Day runner up)
9. Dishwash- If the dishes are coming out clean and the machine us not leaking anywhere then leave it. Unless you have available funds for more upto date version. Again look for sales.
10. Replace Hot Water Tank- check the date on it. There should be an installation sticker on it with a date. If it is getting close to 20- 25ys it should be replaced. Have it inspected if you are concerned about it. (Insurance companies seem to feel 15yrs is a life span for water tanks and they will let you know if you are not insured for flooding in your annual statement)
11. Install security system- You can go wireless fir this and probably get multi cameras for around $500+ (Costco and BestBuy usually have sales or decent prices) I recently bought a WYZE camera from Amazon for $50 and if I want to add more I can. If I want to get a annual subscription ($69+) they will hold all my videos in the cloud.
12. Attic insulation- you can hire a company to put more blown Insulation in or go buy some battens and do it yourself (wear a N95 mask and long sleeves).
13. Repair cracked driveway- is it a big Crack? What is your driveway, concrete or asphalt? Either way you can get some Crack filler (insert joke here) for either one and patch it ( you thought I was going to say fill it didn't  you?) To redo a driveway for a few cracks is overkill but if the driveway is heaved and has multi uneven surfaces  then yes consider new and get a few quotes. This will be costly.
14. Replace windows- if this is an esthetic reason or are they broken? This will be another expensive cost. If the caulking around the windows is cracked you can just re-caulk to save some money.
15. Vent cleaning- I'm assuming you mean dryer vent, which you can do yourself by pulling the dryer away from the wall disconnect the vent and getting a vent brush to clean in the pipe. If you mean ductwork cleaning then you'll have to get a quote from a service. 
16. Lawn mowing- I would recommend getting a lawn mower ( you can get a used one) if you don't have a big lot it is kind of nice to get out on a nice day and cut the lawn.
17. Snow clearing- not so enjoyable to shovel but a little better with a snowblower ( but then you are everyone's best friend in the winter on your street) If you can afford to have someone clear your snow and cut your lawn that frees up personal time. Again get multiple qoutes.

You asked for cost estimates and unfortunately I don't have those numbers as the price of things on the island are different than the mainland. I got the impression you were looking to have someone come in and do the things on your list but I see a few things that can easily be done by you or a group of friends over some beers or wine and food. 
In the end quotes are free for the most part and you can  tally this list up after you get the quotes and get an idea what you are looking at paying for these needs and wants. You'll definitely want to put this list in order of must do to can wait so you can deal with important things first.

You have to go to the law courts at 408 York and fill out a form and then wait for for a super long time. In my experience you need to bug the staff or else they will not process you. They will only ask for the involuntary medical examination if she is a danger to herself or others.

7,4,"First off I want to say I‚Äôm sorry for all the shit you got to deal with, my dad had a severe opioid addiction, so I know some of the struggles that come with it, for the whole family. 

Personally one thing I had to deal with was becoming an addict myself. So last year I finally worked up the courage to walk in to a RAAM (Rapid Access to Addiction Medication) Clinic but made the mistake of going to the one at the Crisis Centre on Bannatyne part of HSC. They made me feel like such a piece of garbage, just a statistic, a waste and a threat to society, so I left (no I wasn‚Äôt in withdrawal, nor get rude or volatile). It just seemed like they were there for their 9 to 5 pay-check. It‚Äôs just a very long, traumatic story and I‚Äôm not here to write about me.

My point is **GO TO THE RAAM ON MAGNUS** . They are absolutely incredible and seem like they actually care and/or want to help. It has a much more welcoming environment and staff. Instead of a tiny barricade vestibule with an intercom in it and miserable condescending lady asking you weird questions though it at Bannatyne Crisis Centre. Then opening the door just a crack with a clip board and security guard continuing to ask you embarrassing questions extremely loud just after you had to yell a bunch of stuff you‚Äôre ashamed of through the speaker. And that was nothing compared to everything else I experienced at Bannatyne. NONE of that at **Magnus Ave** 

But it is first come first serve so the earlier in the day you go the better, maybe even go a bit before they open or call first, because I do know how hard it is to walk through those doors and if your mom is going to be struggling to do so it would be very disheartening to be turned down and told to come back, it happened to me and it sucks. Also I remember them telling me that it gets really bad in the winter with line ups of people down the road, so the sooner you can get her there the better. But I know it‚Äôs MUCH easier said than done because I tried so hard with my dad and it was very difficult so I sincerely wish you and all your loved ones involved the best.

Addiction and substance use is an extremely complicated and difficult cycle to break that will rely entirely on your Mom being not just a willing participant, but completely invested in an outcome because it will be unbelievably hard for her.

It's unfortunate because I have heard land owners specifically say we need CPT to make their land viable for development.

Yet the same department says that we can assess local improvements on ""benefitting properties"" because their property becomes more valuable.

So, if I want a sidewalk in front of my house, or for the city to improve my back lane from gravel, I have to pay for it because my property value improves, but if the city builds regional infrastructure the land speculators don't have to pay for that value increase. Seems legit.

8,4,"I agree that tipping culture isn't great, but as an ex-server I can understand the frustration of not being tipped at all at the end of service. I wasn't there so I obviously can't fully understand the situation, and if the servers were rude throughout your entire time there I do understand not rewarding that. 

What often happened in the bars and restaurants I worked in was that management was shitty, and wouldn't ensure there was enough staff on to cover the floor. It could be extremely(extremely!) stressful, and it usually meant worse service and therefore a lower tip percentage, which I absolutely understand and don't begrudge the customers. But I'd still have to tip out 5% of my total sales to the kitchen/bar/manager(pretty sure it wasn't legal to make us tip out management but it's not uncommon). So if I was running around madly doing my absolute best to get to all my customers, and a table decided not to tip at all, I'm now paying the kitchen/bar/manager out of my own pocket. 

One example I remember is serving a table who racked up a 300$ in an hour. I was friendly and ran like crazy trying to give them the best service I could, despite the huge number of tables I had. At the end of the meal, one guy paid the entire bill and decided not to tip. So I had to pay 15$ out of my own pocket to cover the tip out, And wage at the time was only 12$/hour. The kitchen still got their cut, the bartender got his cut, and the shitty manager got his cut, but I lost over an hour of my wage.

If you do well, you'll get a big tip - if you do ok and don't screw up (or if you screw up and apologize) then I'll give you a decent tip... but if you do really poorly, no I'm not tipping.

I think we totally spent around 40 dollars and I dropped 2 dollars ( my changes on hand). 

She ran to us and pissed at our 2 dollars tip as it was not enough...I was exactly like op and not even able to react... Because I was just shocked of her anger and entitlement and was abit confused of what happened too. It might just her bad day as that place was not known for shitty service whatsoever. But likewise, I didn't go back there anymore and I always wondered is tip mandatory nomatter what...

Now I saw tips required everywhere especially in coffee shop...and the percentage went up way faster than my pay raise...I admitted that I paid coffee shop 80%of the time especially if I gonna stay long (I still make sure I bought something every 3 to 4 hours)...but sometimes I also felt like it's not relevant to how the service is anymore.

In North America we live in a very tip-centric society. The idea of not tipping suggests a very strong standpoint of proving to your server and restaurant staff the whole night was ruined by him or her. What you have to keep in mind is that these tips are not All going to her. There are cooks, table cleaners, and back end staff that all share in the proceeds. 

Let me put it like this, I have no idea what your bill was, but for argument sake let‚Äôs say your portion was 500 dollars. If you‚Äôre able to spend that kind of money does a tip to help out all the people that made the efforts to serve you on the back end affect your financial situation? Adversely if your bill was only 100 bucks, what‚Äôs 10-15 dollars out of your pocket? Is that money you spent really worth the mental anguish and bad karma you feel? For me it‚Äôs not.

I'm 99% sure that server got fired because when the manager of the location called me it sounded like it wasn't really a surprise but wanted to make it right.

It sounds to me like the waitresses were caught up in staffing issues which is pretty common at this point. Doesn't sound like it was any one person's fault that your table wasn't getting good service, and the waitresses themselves certainly didn't deserve the brunt of it. They're going through hell right now with having to be the front line enforcers of Covid protocols and also making dirt wages, and probably rely a lot on tips.

That being said, I don't expect to be treated like a king for it, but if I casually say ""keep the booze coming"" that's both a test to see if they'll listen AND if they'll provide ample service.

We pay out servers more than $2/hour like some US states can pay servers - but we don't pay them a reasonable salary: so Canadian servers still do rely on tips to survive.

That goes both ways.

I've tipped in CA and the US, and *not* tipped in NZ, and all three places, I got good service. I've gotten bad service in the US, but I attribute that to spending way too much time here.

If servers are going to get paid a flat wage, then they won't care as much about service and running around. They'll want their bathroom breaks and lunch breaks (things that don't happen).   


The change would be that managers would be doing their best to make the situation better, instead of having the servers working their ass of to do the best.

$25/hr for daytime server, $30/hr for night time servers.

The reality is that removing the tip structure (won't ever happen) would result in more staff needed because no one will run around like that for $30/hr when they could take a less stressful job $20-25 somewhere else. The reality is that you'd need to limit server sections to about 4-5 tables total, and never have them working 4-9 ever again if they were paid hourly.

Obviously if we made sections smaller and less difficult to manage then the hourly wage wouldn't need to be as high as I first said, but again, that would involve a huge restaurant overhaul.... something that won't ever happen because the system in place works.

It shouldn't be the customers responsibility... but thats the system thats in place. Skip the tip and you punish the staff, because you already paid for the marked up food and drink so the owner isn't hurting. On top of that, you save some money on food and drink by allowing wages to be lower.  


Removing tipping without any major overhaul won't work. The job is too stressful for people to want to keep doing it without tips.

1. How isn't it accurate? Most restaurants, servers do not get a break after 6hrs of work. They sometimes work 8hrs non stop, with short periods of time to eat (if they aren't busy). No FoH staff are sitting down to enjoy a meal or extended break.  


2. Soooo closing a restaurant between 12am and 1am, and opening at 11pm is quite normal for most retail? Some restaurants have people close the place alone, which can and often times is a women... at probably the worse time of the day.

3. If you have to use the bathroom at retail, you go to the bathroom. The customers will still be there when you get back. You don't owe it to them to rush over and help each one. Usually customers will come and find you if they need something.... restaurants you are expected to jump hoops on the customers time. I've done my share of retail before I got into the restaurant industry... It is very different.  


4. I have to laugh... what retail place do you work at because you sound like a hard working individual. Everytime I go to retail shops it's pretty mellow... except during crazy sales days like boxing week and other ones. If you are working a retail place alone consistent I hope you are making decent money... because it sounds like you are hugely under staffed if you are more stressed and working harder then a serving position.

8,4,"FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE: 

It takes anywhere from 16 - 18 months and more to build a building, depending on the size of the building & complexity of the project. There are places in Vancouver/Burnaby that have taken four years to complete. 


As a construction worker since 2008 many of us are putting in 8 & 10 hour days (sometimes more if the need arises) and often working anywhere from 4 - 8 hours on Saturdays (often not given an option) - that's depending on the development project & developers trying not to burn their budget at the beginning of a project because when you get to the last 6 months and there's no money left to complete - and families are packed and waiting to bring their stuff in....there's very little that can be left at the finishing stages.

Developers also have a time line to complete a building and although I can't remember the exact amount of 'fine' if a building isn't completed in the alloted time frame the developer is charged a huge 'late fee' for every day past the 'hand over date"" -  the expected time the project is expected to complete. This date is drawn up way before a shovel even hits the ground along with every step of every benchmark a site must be completed from concrete to landscaping.

The construction field has the highest rate in per person injuries in BC. Most injuries being muscle/skeletal injuries, broken & fractured bones, eye injuries, etc -  some turning into long term disabilities - and some turning into deaths in the industry. The injuries, permanent disabilities and deaths are something we remember every April 28th with a moment of silence on every job site in BC and a memorial service I think at Jack Poole Plaza (I've yet to be able to attend this memorial service) in memory of our coworkers, friends, brothers/sisters who have been injured or died doing what they love doing.

We are an industry that has a huge number of people having retired in the last five years and more getting ready to retire. With construction being such a complex industry from plumbing, electrical, concrete forming, site framing, painting, concrete work, drywall & steel stud you can't just hire any 'Joe or Jane's off the street. These are highly complex work places with dangerous scenarios at every corner. You can't just plod through are area where someone is doing concrete grinding - with power tools and the dangers of silica dust in the air. An area that is red-taped or closed off means you MUST find another way to get where you are going and not push your way through another closed off work area.

You must have your wits about you and not be impaired by alcohol or drugs or tired because your partner had a fight with you into the wee hours. We take our jobs seriously and for the people who do think they can get hired at the front gate because they are 'ready and willing to work' thoes days are long over and that doesn't happen anymore.

Just as we don't want to work with people who aren't capable - you won't want to live in a building that's been put together with substandard construction material (which is overseen by the Site Superintendant) from a reputable supplier) - workers are in the same situation. We don't want to be partnered up with someone who's not been experienced in some aspect of the job. Yes there are tasks that can be taught but very few of thoes jobs go on to become your permanent job and job title.

The people on the floor, actually building your project - don't want to or aren't comfortable working with someone purporting to be a plumber but doesn't know which tool is the wrench. These people slow progress down, are dangerous to be working with/around and are 'found out' fairly quickly. There are only so many things you can bluff your way through on a construction site.

But that means a trade supervisor has wasted time bringing a 'worker' in when reality he's a 'handyman' (a term almost everyone of us dislikes. If you are a 'handyman' please return to hauling backyard trash or doing property clean up. It's a term that does not exist in quality construction & not in any qualified trade.

Just to put a spin on the subject I can truthfully admit that unless a construction worker has a partner making the same amount in wages there are very few of us living in any of the buildings we've worked on. Our wages usually go back into a quality vehicle that can haul tools on weekdays and kids - and dog - to sports and camping on weekends. 

Our other big expense is tools - to do the job - to build your home - and what doesn't get worn out or damaged over the years is replaced by new technology or in many cases - stolen off our job sites - another huge & unfortunate problem in the industry. 

These are jobs we, for the most part, enjoy and just like everyone else, are looking for satisfaction in a very difficult industry surrounded by rules on how something should be constructed to the amount of time/# of breaks and safety rules - and overseen by a difficult climate to work in too.

We do our best and yes we would love being able to pump out multiple highrise sites of great presence and complexity. Unfortunately we are limited by the fact that we physically can only endure working so many hours and working with people who have training or willing to learn an industry that like many others in other industries, require a certificate saying that you are a competent, trained and experienced worker in whatever trade you have chosen


It will never happen but when you do pass the threshold of your new apartment building/home remember that a lot of people put in many hours building your new place, be it an apartment with one or three bedrooms, a house with a huge backyard and pool or a three storey walk-up & be thankful we didn't build 100,000 suites in a one year period that way you can feel somewhat comforted with we didn't build your home in a rush with less than proven quality products and produced by knowledgable and trained workers.

Paramedics alternate roles from attendant and driver, but are equally trained, with the driver taking on a supportive role while the other focuses primarily on assessments/interventions.

RBC used to be free of the crackheads and many more small shops used to be open. Hell, we even had the night market back in the day. Like not only did the slums slowly take over Chinatown, but the gentrification also erases what we had left. At this rate, will we even still have a Chinatown in 20 years?

The new generation of Chinese-Canadians aren‚Äôt interested in cleaning up the bottomless homeless and drug problem.

It‚Äôs also the common stereotype that Chinatown is dirty and old fashioned, where only old people buy groceries. New immigrants don‚Äôt go to Chinatown as most come from Mainland China which clashes with the fact that Vancouver‚Äôs Chinatown is traditionally Cantonese. There‚Äôs also not much to see anymore other than needles, graffiti, and human feces as many traditional businesses and authentic businesses have closed or relocated to somewhere else over the last 25 years. 

Chinatown died in the late 90s when Richmond started booming with Chinese businesses and malls. It was also because of the drug problem which became a lot worse in the DTES during that time.

Today, all of those immigrants are dead or in their 70's. Their children (my generation) grew up in Canada with much less exposure to Chinese culture. I can half-speak Cantonese, but not well enough to juggle a detailed conversation.

My children will probably not learn any Chinese dialect because I'm not fluent enough to teach them. They'll grow up Canadian....with even less knowledge of Chinese culture.

Now that the social housing is all allocated for housing the DTES residents there's a heightened danger and fear factor.  

There's no incentive left to stay in that area.  Not to mention, the new ""demographic"" of people are probably not gonna pay for Asian veggies and meats so that would mean the Chinese businesses will just shutter.

Chinatown, like other neighborhoods, should be fine but it just needs the City to figure out some very hard social issues. If the issues plaguing the DTES are mitigated, the entire area should resume the gentrification.

If you can accept that Chinatown is right next to the DTES and there‚Äôs an ongoing crisis (that desperately needs more attention), there‚Äôs actually some great things happening in Chinatown. 

There‚Äôs still cheap, incredible baked goods at Chinese-owned bakeries, there‚Äôs still great dimsum, massive lunch boxes from Kent‚Äôs kitchen, 5 dollar banh mis and pork/rice, and the best chicken wings in town at Phnom Penh. There‚Äôs still local plant stores and grocers and markets where a literal sack of sesame seeds is cheaper than a tiny pouch down the road at nesters. A lot of these long-time businesses are learning to adapt (which is what you need to do as a business) to the mixed audience they now serve. 

In addition, there‚Äôs new Asian-owned business like propaganda coffee, mello donuts and Dd mau. And a ton of new joints from people that care about community safety and take pride in preserving some of that heritage. 

There is so many newer spots bringing good food and great establishments popping up, from Oyster Express to Pizza Coming Soon to Bar Gobo to Bao Bei to Juke Fried Chicken and Hunnybee Cafe, Harvest, Thank You Pizza, Barbara, etc. 

There‚Äôs vintage stores, sneaker shops, record shops, massy books ‚Äî- Chinatown is turning into something new but it‚Äôs alive, unlike gastown and some of the other historical points of the city.

My impression is that this isnt so much a new generation problem, rather that Vancouver doesn't seem to have a proper strategy to deal with rough sleepers and drug affected citizens. I don't think it's fair to blame their inaction on the local community. My cynical take is that Chinatown has never had the money behind it that most other inner city areas have had, so I imagine it is less of a headache for council to contain the homelessness problem in an area where people won't scream bloody murder about the homeless camps in front of their multimillion dollar apartments.",t3_seilvl,Drugs or Alcohol

One is working class people forced into an ethnic enclave who created a successful community called Chinatown right next to the heart of Vancouver. Over 100 years of Chinese heritage was put into Chinatown and I honestly think it represents the heart of Chinese Canadians.

The other is rich wealthy people who moved to Richmond who created their own community to enjoy freedoms while avoiding Chinese rule (aka the government) and did not want to live in that enclave of Chinatown yet wanted the necessities (thus all the businesses they brought over).

They are completely different people from one another. Of course it is very easy to hate on rich Chinese people because I did too. I mean how does anyone feel when rich Chinese people show up with over billions of dollars in cash, start their own city and bring thousands of import and grocery businesses and banks. I was pretty pissed because of the same reason as you. I grew up with Chinatown being part of my childhood.

But can you really blame them? Because of DTES no of them wanted to live in Chinatown and for years homeless people were dumped in Chinatown by police because it was out of the way in an ethnic enclave and the city always turned a blind eye to infrastructure in the area.

This brought in cash, which helped Chinatown grow and supported the Chinese community. But nowadays, Chinese immigrants don‚Äôt have to cater to western tastes. They are able to open successful shops and restaurants that cater to their own community. If you really want to feel immersed in current Chinese/ HK culture, go to Aberdeen or Crystal Mall. If you want to feel like you‚Äôre in Taiwan back in the 70‚Äôs, I highly suggest going to Memory Corner restaurant in Richmond.

Two main things have exacerbated the situation there and it's fentanyl and lack of housing.

The Downtown Eastside also has a large urban Indigenous population and we are just beginning now (as non-Indigenous people living on these lands) to collectively show some deeper understanding of the effects that colonization has had on Indigenous people and the ongoing effects of intergenerational trauma.

But. What's going in Canada reminds me of what it's like for many immigrants in Dubai who aren't wealthy white folks. Just a lot of exploitation to have a permanent enslaved underclass. 

We have to talk about immigration in a way that's beneficial for people arriving here. Yeah, when folk came to Ellis Island, America spoke about letting a lot in. A couple things: there was **zero** social and government welfare or guarantees like healthcare, food, housing, etc.. A lot of folks lived in tenement housing, abusive work conditions, and so on, it wasn't pretty. People died of starvation or the elements all the time. And also cruiseliners were on the hook for the cost of sending folks back if there were actually ineligible (which meant a lot of vetting was done at the departure port.)  

Today, we do have community and governmental social welfare supports and programs. The reality is, that costs money and takes a lot of logistics and resources to dole out properly. We can't meet the demand and people end up getting exploited. We changed and limited immigration in part in modern systems (like the last few decades) in part to lessen exploitation of foreigners and to also ensure wage depression domestically doesn't happen.

It's getting bad. There's crazy camp outs going on.. And I see them no where near the train.  I had several ask me where they could camp out. It's routine to see tent cities by the rivers now. Or off of deerfoot. 

Transit spreads it farther around the city, anywhere the train runs.. It allows this to permeate deep into multiple communities. And a bunch is purely nefarious. 

Marlborough is effectively a cesspool, I see cops show up in numbers to ensure things aren't out of thier control. And the amount of businesses who now lock thier doors and question the transient who come in to even show them money..

Believing in people is hard. Glorifying their long drawn out suicide is not an essential stop on the road to recovery. It's certainly the easiest and nicest path, but its clearly the most harmful. The homeless mortality rate is now 40 times worse than the situation harm reduction claimed it was going to fix 15 years ago. Harm reduction kills, it is genocide. Housing first? Over 80% of overdose fatalities happen alone in a house. Housing is a death sentence for many addicts without real professional help. It's not surprising Housing first initiatives don't reduce harm. Homeless is the symptom not the cause of drug addiction.

9,4,"Unfortunately this crisis is moreso a symptom of other larger issues than it is a problem on its own. Here is a list of issues that contribute to the problem and some potential solutions for said issues.

Mental health problems. Alberta, nay, Canada is severely lacking in accessible mental health treatment options. The best providers are locked behind a paywall and the free providers are locked behind wait lists spanning months-years and don‚Äôt always provide the best care. My spouse and I are housed and even we are having trouble accessing these services.

Disability/physical health problems. Unfortunately our medical system is currently overloaded by COVID. This means that wait times for physical health problems are also fairly long right now, which doesn‚Äôt play nicely with the fact that Covid/long covid is actually causing more disability to occur in our population. So our disabled population is increasing while services to help disabled people are decreasing or suppressed. Many people who were previously capable of working are now struggling to make ends meet because they are disabled now. Most employers are reluctant to or outright refuse to accommodate disabled staff long term.

Poverty. While we all love an underdog come from the bottom now we here story, the reality is that most people born into poverty have very little upward mobility in life. Most people born impoverished will die in similar circumstances. This sucks, lacking the money you need to survive sucks. I‚Äôve been in situations before where I had to choose between buying tampons and buying food and it‚Äôs not a choice I‚Äôd wish on anyone, I definitely was choking back tears in the store. In our capitalist society, poverty makes people feel helpless, worthless and desperate.

Addiction. I‚Äôm putting this here because it is often the outcome of the above problems lacking solutions. Very few people actively enjoy or want to be addicts. The overwhelming majority of addicts are self-medicating for problems they are struggling or failing to solve. Many of us (hi, yes, while I am in recovery I will technically always be an addict) developed our addictions in childhood to cope with abusive home situations/undiagnosed mental illness/poverty/bullying/etc before we had the agency to change our situations. I started doing opiates at 13 and consider myself incredibly lucky to be in recovery and housed but I had lots of help and support and it took years to get to where I am now.

Lack of accessible assistance. While we do have options for shelters, welfare, treatments, AISH, etc, many of these services are inaccessible to the people who most need them. Shelters are notoriously over crowded, understaffed, underfunded, restrictive dangerous spaces. Many shelters require residents to arrive early in the day to secure a spot and will not allow residents to use or be inebriated while there. While this probably makes sense to non addicts, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for addicts. Addicts are generally not doing drugs to have a fun trip, they typically have a dependence on one or more substances and not taking those substances will instantly launch them into withdrawal. Depending on the substance and strength of addiction, withdrawal itself can be life threatening/cause symptoms that can result in psychosis and/or becoming a danger to oneself/others. Most people, let alone addicts, will avoid this level of discomfort at all costs. 

Shelters aside, there‚Äôs a swath of other services that are inaccessible for various reasons. Scientifically, the most effective way to treat addiction is with extensive harm reduction infrastructure. We need safe ingestion sites, safe needle exchanges, and nonjudgmental addictions counselling. Whether you like the idea of these things or not, they have proven to be the most effective options for handling this problem. 

Services like aish and welfare also play a part here, most of these services require applicants to have a permanent address, ID, and all kinds of other documentation that even housed folks struggle with. Once you‚Äôve got all your documents and an address, you have to fill out an insane amount of paperwork and get even more paperwork filled out by doctors and social workers. There are generally fees attached to getting all this paperwork filled out and sent to the right place. Can you see why someone who is barely managing to exist might struggle to access these services?

So all in all, we have a bunch of problems and a bunch of services that aren‚Äôt accessible or functioning properly. What can we do? Well there are 2 main options: 

- Improve and expand the existing services. get involved with/fund/advocate for more/better public services. Write to city council, donate to services that you think are doing the right thing. At the very least, don‚Äôt vote for platforms that would further strip the scant services we have and maybe do vote for platforms that expand these services. Yes, we may have to pay more tax but that should be expected in a capitalist society where we have to pay to get what we want.

- Direct/mutual aid. See someone struggling? Maybe try talking to them, find out what they need to improve their situation. Do you have an extra winter jacket lying around that you don‚Äôt need? Maybe give it to the shivering homeless guy you see at the station. Volunteer with groups that help these folks, donate to food banks and orgs that help.

Sorry for the long post but this issue is fairly complex and I wanted to do it justice. There is an additional third option where we overthrow the billionaires and work together to redistribute wealth and create a better society, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre there quite yet. More than anything please remember that big problems like this take time and patience to solve. You can‚Äôt take a feral abused cat and put it in a house and expect it to be instantly domesticated. We need to aim for incremental changes that will eventually turn into big changes. I know many of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt like tent city, but perhaps a tent is the logical next step for someone sleeping on the floor in a train station. Get the people off the floor and into a tent, then figure out how to get the people in tents into homes. Get the people doing crack on the train to do their crack in safe ingestion sites where they will have better access to addiction treatment.

&#x200B;

I mean, it's already a crime to do drugs in public, trespass, and attack people, right? Making it more illegal isn't going to change anything. And all enforcement does is maybe arrest offenders if they can catch them, but by that point the public is already traumatized. The best you can hope for is... revenge? Punishment?

So what? Pre-emptively lock up homeless people in case they are one of the bad ones? Force them into rehab so they can come out and relapse knowing they'll get another comfy trip to a government rehab centre in the middle of nowhere?

&#x200B;

So the other option is to treat the root causes which are myriad. You can't force someone to take mental illness treatment unless you want to subject them to ECT or lobotomization or whatever. You can lock someone up until they detox off drugs but they'll just want to get high again.

Right off the bat, the question springs to mind as to whether a person is homeless because they got addicted to drugs... Or did they begin abusing drugs to cope with life on the streets, eventually leading to mental illness?

Case in point, a very common pathway to homelessness is abuse at home forcing the individual to leave with nowhere to go but the streets.  Things spiral down from there.

Another very common pathway is as a byproduct of institutional racism.  Witness all the trouble that is still occurring from the residential school system.

In many ways homelessness is the end result of prior system failure.  So the solution is found further up the chain, by investing in everything from affordable housing, to social services, to mental health supports, to harm reduction strategies.

Without fixing the problem (root cause), they will all eventually spiral into a situation of homelessness (as soon as they run out of resources / enablement / support) OR they make a decision to help themselves recover.  

The self-destruction and the destruction around them still happens, it just happens somewhere other than on the LRT in plain site.  

Fix the root cause and people have a chance.

9,4,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this comment. It sounds just like Federal Prison. 
Along with the detoxing , a majority of these humans struggling with mental health issues/ addiction have deep rooted trauma from childhood, past events and current, that have led to numerous problematic behaviours that they may not even be aware of or even recognize. They need more programming to help these individuals recognize the patterns of this. But‚Ä¶..Participation and a willingness to change  along with admitting you have a problem are a #1 must towards a better future for oneself. 
As an ex addict, I found that the programs they offer to the public are very much different than the programs I took and participated in, in federal prison. Who knows, things may have changed since 2018. Those programs were mandatory if you wanted to seek parole. I did agree to participate, but most importantly I WANTED TO. My whole perspective changed after that sentence. Mental health resources are great but one must put in the work to build a great connection with one specific worker or a group of people you trust. Lifelong network of  positive support can seem daunting to have to build when you‚Äôre mental health is crushing you or your addiction is at peak. But sticking with it is a choice one makes. I‚Äôm nearing 5 years of sobriety and even though it‚Äôs vastly different than the first 6months-2 years of sobriety I have made the effort myself to participate in mental health groupS, addiction meetings and I know that I have people I can reach out to when I need to.",t3_yufjbv,Drugs or Alcohol

By calling these people ‚Äúunhoused‚Äù you‚Äôre perpetuating the problem.  Just call it as it is, thr vast majority  are mentally unstable / drug dependent people that need medical help.  They are incapable of helping themselves.  They are incapable of making rational decisions on their own to benefit their (and others) welfare.

They should be held and treated until they are capable.  A small fraction maybe people down on their luck that just need a hind - up for a short period.

9,4,"I'm actually not against self harm. In my heyday, I tried many drugs. I've long since retired from them, but I still drink and remain a drug positive person. It was an awesome time in my life and I'm lucky to have lived in a country where I had that freedom. Anyone can think what they want, it was admittedly stupid and I'm not promoting it, but it's who I am. 

Where I draw the line is when it starts infringing on other people's property rights or ability to be safe. I was not violent. I never drove drunk or messed up. I never bothered anyone, beyond probably talking too much. I kept it fun and was careful with how often I indulged in drugs and alcohol. 

I think anyone who's losing grasp of that can and should be helped as soon as possible whether they want it or not. If you are committing crimes and finding it hard to function in society with your addiction, let's get you help now. No waiting 5 crime filled years of living on the street to be ready. We start today. You'll probably fail a bunch of times. So does everyone when something that important is on the line. It doesn't mean you don't try. People who never fail are people that achieve nothing valuable. It's OK. The next time you get picked up for a crime, we try again with the lessons we learned last time. Drugs are one hell of a master to shake - we learn and move forward with the lessons from our failures.

It took me 4 serious efforts to finally quit smoking for good. Meth, Heroin, Fent etc probably make quitting smoking look like a vacation. It's going to 100% suck, but their loved ones need them and we should be on THEIR team to get them back home safe, not representing a mentally ill addict by enabling their decline. Addicts need their loved ones too, whether their addiction gives them this clarity, or not. Treatment, not harm reduction is how you save lives. 

Anyone who had a period of drug use that ended up not being problematic, like me, knows exactly how they would have reacted if they were told ""you have a problem""

I would have been pissed. The only difference between being right and wrong about that feeling is how you were raised, the friends you keep and a healthy dose of luck. It's not surprising many addicts don't want help. We all start into that shitty dangerous forest as non-problematic, and clarity isn't a strong suit once you've crossed the line. 

If I had crossed over during that period, I wouldn't have had the cognition to do it on my own. I'd have known intrinsically that I was fine and my drug use was as non-problematic as it had always been. When your mind has gone, you are gone. 

The happy healthy version of me today would want you to help that sick version of me - regardless of what that suffering addict thought or had to say.",t3_yufjbv,Drugs or Alcohol
9,4,"My solution is forced treatment. That includes closely superivised detoxes using substances such as methadone to make that hell as safe and humane as possible. It might take 6 go-rounds, but trying and failing to achieve something huge in life is far better than trying nothing and always being successful.

 It also gets them away from the general public who they terrorize and victimize every single day. There is no right to be off your face intoxicated in public. There is no right to push your stolen belongings around in a stolen shopping cart. There is no right to present imminent danger to those in your surroundings. However there is a right to human dignity that these sick, unfortunate souls do have a right to. A right that you don't have be be a sociologist to see is sorely lacking.

Vancouver experienced 130 overdose deaths in 2003 when harm reduction was implemented. They had 4000 last year. Fentanyl has been used medically for over 40 years. It's not what's changed. Access to drugs and ease of lifestyle is what has changed. These are priorities of Harm reduction.

Stats are a tricky game with health in Canada. Every provincial agency gets to write its own report card. This is the reason we don't know how many Canadians die each year waiting for surgeries on a list. That would be a disgusting number if we had it, so there isn't a health agency in the country that tracks or reports on it. Ever notice how no provincial health agency has ever had a underperforming year? Harm reduction is granted a similar level of corruptability in their reporting. 

When we allowed Big Tobacco to report on itself, 8 out of 10 doctors reccomended Marlboro. When you let harm reduction report on itself, they are doing the greatest job ever - despite what we all clearly see.",t3_yufjbv,Drugs or Alcohol

While it is terrible, forced treatment would be the easiest way to deal with this- however, who would pay for that? Not to mention the backlash the government would receive as well because it‚Äôd be considered inhumane to force people into rehab/treatment. It‚Äôs a double-edged sword really.

They have shown that  yes 1 in 6 at some point return to homelessness which I would argue is success. this is an approach essentially the opposite of transitional housing where the individual needs to ‚Äòearn‚Äô more and more permanent housing. Transitional housing has its faults was tried out in Sweden and it was shown to have people left in limbo some homeless not good enough at following rules to level up, some homeless stuck following all the rules but the private sector landlords not willing to grant these formerly homeless people tenant rights. Yes transitional housing has its place but it‚Äôs been proven not to work. That‚Äôs what canada is doing now. The housing first approach is what works. Give them what they need (shelter privacy autonomy) way better than being put in a shelter where many experience violence from other homeless people lack of privacy (some people get robbed in shelters when they are in a huge room with row of beds) it‚Äôs a complex issue and the only answer is to give them adequate housing. The high level of open beds in shelters is because shelters do not work. How can you guarantee safety from Covid for example? You can‚Äôt. And homeless people are free to decide and pick living outdoors vs catching Covid for example. Shelters are a temp solution.

CPS do this. They have an encampment team through PAL. They have PACT teams that pair an AHS worker with a Cop and who conduct visits.

And this doesnt include your CPS CRO's who are assigned to various districts and who do exactly what you're asking for. Community resource officers are working daily in your community, doing site inspections at buildings, meeting with home owners associations and local community groups to establish problem areas.

The goal is to resource them, but most of the vulnerable are uninterested. Community-based policing is largely proactive.

Nobody wants to hear about police budgets, but a non-emergency call in this city can see you waiting on the side of the road for 4-12 hours before an officer responds.

Production numbers in most cases are still down for new cars, however most brands have inventory starting to build now. Because production was so much lower in 2020-2022, that meant there would be a lot less future used car inventory available. On top of that many people suddenly had more money and purchased a lot of the units which compounded the problem short and long term. Lots of dealers still being greedy like 2021-2022 and forcing fees (mandatory PPF, mandatory extended warranty, etc) on new products, hopefully they will continue to get a rude awakening. Interest rates are also a problem, some people having now only sub prime as an option for financing. Popular models (think hybrid Toyotas, Porsche GT cars, and vehicles that traditionally have low depreciation curves) are continuing to be very strong in both new and used markets. Many people are also massively underwater on their vehicles and don‚Äôt want to accept the fact that they won‚Äôt be buying a new vehicle every 1-3 years at the same price and depreciation curve as it has been previously (think pre 2021 prices but 2021-2022 strength in used prices). These people are not willing to accept their vehicles aren‚Äôt worth what they are now asking. I see many many vehicles on Kijiji listed privately for 50+ days, some as high as 315 days now. These are just some of the current factors locally right now. For sure used inventory is WAY down, I used to see 5000+ manual vehicles listed in Calgary on Kijiji and the last year or two it‚Äôs been hovering about half that just for one data point.

That being said there‚Äôs still deals to be had, new and used. My father purchased (custom order) a 2023 BMW M2 in June 2023, paid cash and was ~$3k under MSRP out the door.

The most potent substance isn't always the most popular/or most wanted. Most people are not going to be using fentanyls unless they have pretty much no choice.

Most people would be happy with oxycodone or morphine level strength opioids and not go further. 

Most people don't even want free drugs, they just want reasonable access to buy them.

As for potency as a selling feature‚Äîit‚Äôs debatable; to one degree the danger of addiction is the diminishing return with continued use which entails you either use more or use something more potent. Whether or not you necessarily want something more potent might be inconsequential, however when you are going through withdrawals you‚Äôll take what you can get. In that regard; I do like what Portugal has done with decriminalization by make it an administrative offence and encouraging rehabilitation.

Yes there will be those who keep going for the most potent/pushing the limits. However those people are a very small % of opiate users.  yet even for those people we can mitigate their issues.

 Society can control substances in a different way, we can allow for monthly limits, or licensing for users, or even allowing those more potent substances to be available by prescription only

&#x200B;

>, however when you are going through withdrawals you‚Äôll take what you can get

this is one reason why people switch to more potent opioids, because it's the only thing available, then their tolerance becomes to high for their previous DOC. By allowing weaker opiates to be available, it mitigates increasing tolerance from lack of availability.

I would actually love the prescription method; but also should point out I think prescriptions should be covered by our universal health care. That way we treat drug addiction for what it is; a disorder that requires medical assistance. But I think on a federal level there needs to be a better push towards treatment (and that requires hiring people to fulfill those services). What I wouldn't want to see is it turning into anyone walking into an SIS (as an example) and getting free drugs because that's just enabling dangerous behaviour and not providing a means for someone to actually better themselves and get out of their situation.

Addiction is not just about chemical hooks.  We are told that so the pharmaceutical industry has a market to sell their solutions to (and that's also why you can find science to support that).

I'm not totally discounting chemical hooks and, if nothing else, addicts become addicted to the spectacular dopamine rush when they use.  But environment plays a role, AND, addicts can get on the other side if they have sufficient motivation, supports, and if their environmental triggers change.

It's correct to say for sure that people want to buy strong drugs, and I know people who've kicked heroin, but I've never heard of anyone intentionally seeking out F as a recreational drug, but if they are, I'm much more supportive of having a safe source of that than just random dealers distributing it. If people want heroin, they're going to get heroin, it's literally the best thing in the world, but I'd hope that heroin is what they're getting, so they survive and have a chance of moving on.

That's not to say that people aren't intentionally using heroin, I just don't know how often that's an intentional recreational thing. To me it seems more like something people get when they're on their deathbed.

The overdose thing is... really really really fucking bad and sad and real, but I can't say I know that much about it.

In addition, taking a wild shot in the dark at numbers, if 600 people per day in BC do heroin in some form, and only 0.5% of those people get a more potent opioid, then another 0.5% of those people overdose anyway, you get approx this year's daily overdose count.

I realize your example is just just poking fun at some of the less dangerous potential addictions, but people who are severely alcohol dependent may actually require ""free"" alcohol to be administered if they're detoxing, the point being with fentanyl, other opioids and some other drugs is that it's much more likely for a random dose to be deadly, so the goal is to reduce the likelihood of death.

As for the people in your life that are sick through no fault of there own and are forced to pay money to access their healthcare needs, I think that's awful. I understand that it can be frustrating to watch those you care about struggle because the system seems to leave them behind, but society  has deemed that we're okay with that. If you have an issue with the government not paying for things like diabetes care and heart medicine please, PLEASE vote for politicians in favor of increasing medical coverage.

""Free drugs"" is just one pillar of that solution, and you are right, in a vacuum, just giving people drugs isn't a solution. But as part of a harm reduction strategy, it's a necessary evil.

7,5,"It‚Äôs not really supposed to necessarily, that‚Äôs why safe supply proponents are in favour of increased access to a variety of other supports. Safe supply keeps people from overdosing primarily that‚Äôs it‚Äôs only real goal on its own. It‚Äôs like a car, the wheels are there to keep it moving but how are you supposed to see when it‚Äôs dark out? The wheels don‚Äôt do the function of the headlights but together every part has an important role.

That being said there are some effects safe supply has that is beneficial here. For mental health the ability to get a safe steady supply means less unneeded stress of dealing with the constantly changing street supply. No worry that your dealer died or got arrested and you won‚Äôt have access to the drug you‚Äôre dependent on. No worry that you‚Äôll die from a toxic batch or one of differing potency from the last. No need to commit crimes to sustain use, etc.

Physical health: Many of the harms of drug use come from it being illegal. For example pharmaceutical grade substances means you‚Äôre not potentially shooting up inactive synthesis byproducts, chemicals, etc that may have more harmful effects on the body than the drug itself (see the case of desomorphine/krocodile). 

Poverty: Addiction is very expensive, not having to commit crimes to sustain a habit and being able to pursue legal job opportunities because you‚Äôre on a stable dose you get covered is huge. 

Once again while there certainly are benefits to these areas as I listed, safe supply is not the only thing important here. There needs to be good social supports in place in addition to safe supply. Safe supply is one piece of the puzzle.

Addiction treatment is health care. The alternative of paying taxes for ""people to get high"" is paying taxes to arrest and imprison users, treat expensive harms from illicit use such as HIV, play the cat and mouse game against an endless global drug supply.

If they are in the state where the amount of safe supply they are allotted doesn't prevent withdrawals of course they'll go back to street fentanyl. When it comes to opioids most agree fentanyl is not qualitatively as enjoyable as a more traditional opioid such as diacetylmorphine, hydromorphone or oxycodone. It is the fact that fentanyl is extremely cheap and readily available as well as many times more potent that leads users to take it for the most part. If the safe supply program isn't able to meet the user where they are at then of course it wont do much good. That's a failure of actual program not of the idea of safe supply, its a policy problem.",t3_194zuc0,Drugs or Alcohol

People can form addictions to anything, it's just unfortunate that some have gotten addicted to drugs.

People use drugs for a variety of reasons and it is not often a simple choice between drugs and sobriety in the way you may think (although I am happy that for you it was never an issue that's great). Many people have traumas, mental health disorders, lack of social supports, financial insecurity, physical ailments, etc etc etc that make turning to drugs not as irrational a choice as you may think on the surface. The biopsychosocial model of addiction I believe explains this fairly well if you want to read further. On top of that, once someone is addicted and/or dependent on a given drug this may further complicate things incredibly and make getting off the drugs that much harder. I am all for personal responsibility and being accountable for ones actions believe me, but punishing people via prohibition (especially when the harms that come from drug use are largely a byproduct of prohibition itself) for putting something in their bodies you don't like is not productive in my opinion and I believe does more harm than good.",t3_194zuc0,Drugs or Alcohol

7,5,"I‚Äôm not totally convinced that it is that much harder to be a casual opioid user than with other drugs necessarily. From my personal experience with various drugs as well as drug users it typically comes down to preference. I personally find opioids to be my drug of choice but many people find them to be garbage and overhyped, on the other hand I know many stimulant users yet I find stimulants repulsive. The data I think I linked earlier does find heroin specifically to be the second highest rate in in problematic drug use (second to nicotine) however it‚Äôs hard to say whether this number isn‚Äôt inflated as a result of social acceptance and availability.

I don‚Äôt doubt the data you may have seen but would like to give it a read if you do find it as what I have read finds the majority of opioid users to not be problematic in their use, this is also what is echoed by experts in the field such as David Nutt and Carl Hart.

As for medical users converting to heroin that‚Äôs an established thing yes but many of said users do so because of being cut off from their meds and switching to heroin due to cost efficiency and lack of access to pharmaceutical alternatives. Recreational users often make the jump to heroin due to cost of pharmaceutical options, not because heroin is preferable to something like oxycodone or hydromorphone.

My concern with a medical model is that anyone outside of that system is left on the exact same place we are right now, reliant on illicit channels as opposed to a regulated one which is driving overdoses.",t3_194zuc0,Drugs or Alcohol

8,5,"We are a good 10 years behind and I‚Äôm being very conservative. Personally, I believe drugs should be free. There would be fewer addicts and health concerns. Doctors and nurses would stay here to provide care this I turn enables paramedics to help your loved one rather than someone who OD‚Äôd on je street. 

Cops would be able to go after real criminals like big business. If drugs are free and we do right by the working girls we will essentially cutting the legs off of gangs. 

The majority of addicts are the regular people you see every day: your teachers, bus drivers, bankers etc. in other words, they are functioning addicts not what you see around pigeon park which is less than 10% of the addicted population.

Studies overseas have shown that removing taboos helps lower rates of addiction. Remove the shame and it drastically can change things for the better. 

Nobody wakes up in the morning saying I want to be a n addict. Addiction starts as a bandage. We use to fill a void. This can be due to trauma if any kind mental physical it doesn‚Äôt matter. 

So, if drugs are free the user isn‚Äôt spending a massive amount of time on trying to figure out how to procure their drug of choice. Many revert to crime. This is what really kills not the drugs. Meaning that drugs are given to patients all the time and they don‚Äôt normally die. They are told how to use and follow direction. Doctors and nurses know about tolerance and how to use safely and many of them can lead long productive lives. However, those that do not have that sort of lifestyle are more likely to die. It‚Äôs the lifestyle that kills things like bad dope, sharing needles, bad hygiene, improper self care and not eating well for example. 

How can they do the things they need to be able to do what they need for themselves. Risking death and prison does not lead to hood problem solving and decision making. But if the drugs are free and safe you start to see change. People can start to work part time and save money that they couldn‚Äôt do before.  Now you will see people taking care of themselves. They get proper medical and dental care. Get clothes a nice place to live furniture etc. Now the void is being filled positively and they don‚Äôt need dope to fill the void and via harm reduction rather than abstinence things start to get better all around.

Lastly, things like insurance will not keep rising. It won‚Äôt go down because of greed but it won‚Äôt go up if car theft, home invasions, shoplifting etc won‚Äôt be occurring at the rates they are happening now. 

10 years or so ago when I wrote a paper about this for a psychopharmacology class I showed how we would have more productive members of society, lower addiction rates, lower crime rates and we would be able to save $7B in criminal Justice and medical alone. We can then take that money and put it into education, treatment, and other important areas.

Problem is our system can only thrive if man is hopeless, helpless, uneducated, sick, as in a rut. These marginalized people then lead to crime and to the medical system. They are easy to scare and therefore control. They essentially are job security for our justice system. Police whines about how crime is going up and  they need more cops. So they ask for $x get more cops. Well obviously more cops will be able to catch more criminals. They then go whine again about how the crime rate is going up and they need more cops and money. $x amount wasn‚Äôt enough so we need more. But these stats don‚Äôt mean crime has gone up. The crime rate could be exactly the same but more cops catch more people.  But the people fall for this bs hook line and sinker. Anyways that‚Äôs my rant.",t3_137a2ge,Drugs or Alcohol

These drugs also create more chemicals in your brain than can be produced naturally, which makes getting off of them *super* shitty. 

Even in cancer treatment, when I had an opioid post-surgery, the fucking sadness after day 5 post-op when I had no more, was **brutal**. I can't even imagine taking doses that people do to get high. 

People forget how many folks died from opioid and street meth usage *before* fentanyl ever existed or that people's nasal cavities weren't grossly blasted to shit from usage or bodies decayed from usage. It's not as if fent was something that started killing people. Most of the opioid deaths that I experienced in my community were well before fent.

You develop a tolerance, then your brain is like alright I **need** this drug. When you develop that height of tolerance, you are now getting into LD-50 territory, or the lethal dosage. That means whatever shit you take is now a much higher chance of death. Narcan doesn't revive a dead body.

But no, I've been downvoted to hell because these folks don't want to hear what actually fucking happens to you when you push your tolerance and develop an addiction. Go to rehab and see the lives it has destroyed and how much damn work it takes to pull it together. Why in the everloving fuck do y'all want to fuck around and find out with this shit?

Alcohol is indeed an extremely dangerous drug that has greatly harmed individuals and society. Its availability on menus everywhere and the lack of social stigma associated with social drinking leads new people to start using it more than any other drug.  Its ubiquity also makes it much harder for addicts (alcoholics) to quit.

If I had to seek alcohol out the way yesterday I would have had to seek out cocaine I may not have beer in my fridge.  Today I might try cocaine off the menu.  That's my point.

I am not advocating laws or enforcement, simply highlighting the danger.  We can choose to accept it, like we do alcohol, but better we do so with eyes open.

And using cigarettes is extremely discouraged. There isn't talk of ""oh it's okay because it's to party!""

And I'm willing to accept some people don't want treatment. I've heard that 'forced treatment doesn't work', which is fine. TBH I'm fine with people doing whatever they want (as long as they have the capacity to make their own decisions). If their drug use or addiction gets to a point that it starts harming others (violence, theft etc), then they should be given access to drug treatment as they go through the penal system.

So yes, free treatment. But also free safe supply, detox, low barrier housing, supportive housing, abstinence-based services, social assistance - all coupled with rigorous public health messaging and education and policies to eliminate systemic discrimination against people who use substances. You'll find very few people who got sober and changed their lives because the government forced them to. Drug users deserve the dignity of being able to make a choice, just like we all do. There is no silver bullet here, and so many of our knee-jerk reactions and judgements around drug users are situated in our own personal values and discomfort.

8,5,"The concept of letting people do what they want is fine, the problem in practice is that with a substance like fent, it is very quickly no longer the person making choices well before they start committing crimes or being violent. Before you knoe it it's the drug that wants to do the drug and not the person making that choice. So when should they be put into the penal system? Self harm is still harm, and I don't agree that someone could be said to be if sound mind and body while in active addiction. Draining your tfsa, rrsp, not making child support payments, losing your job, losing your place, etc. Doesn't directly harm anyone, but no one should have to find themselves destitute before being recognized as needing help.

With what others are commenting, etc, I'd like to say that funding well paid professionals, etc, the best of the best to come coach addicts through recovery won't be as much help as sounds like is hoped. If a councilor or therapist doesn't have first hand experience with addiction, homelessness, or recovery outside of their profession then a lot of people experiencing these things don't really give a shit about what they have to say. A lot of these people have a need to be understood if they're going to get better and whether or not these professionals have the tools that can help them doesn't matter if the people who need help don't feel they can talk to them.

That said, those who DO work in this field deserve so much more compensation. Fund clinics more, pay the staff more, reduce cost barriers to assistance, pull our heads out of our asses about low barrier shelters and government housing and safe injection sites- they all need an overhaul. They give dealers office space, they give dealers a home base, they give dealers a place to stay in the same room as those whose addictions they're enabling. It's so turned on its head it's insane.

Stand outside the A&W on Granville, near Nelson. Yell ""Taxi!"" and see how many people stick their head out the windows or come out of the apartment building just to the south. Dealers, ready to ask what it is you're looking for.

Go to The Gathering Place, a community center on Helmken Seymour, and you'll find it doubling as a shelter at night where everyone sleeps on the floor in the same space. God bless the staff who work there, but you'll find dealers of every drug using that place, and you'll find them side by side with those who they've put there. Addicts being addicts, addicts struggling to get clean, addicts waiting for a bed to open in a treatment center or detox, all the while dealers eye them, nod to them, offer to front them free drugs for their bank info as collateral. It's insane that anyone gets clean.

If youre looking for somewhere to donate to, I would suggest RAAC, the Rapid Access Addictions Center based out of St Pauls. The social workers there are literal angels. Alex, Matt, Jenn, and their doctors too. I believe the donation needs to be made out to St Pauls and in the details noted that it is for RAAC, as per what the staff has told me.

If you or someone you know are looking for help with addiction, I cannot recommend that you visit RAAC enough. Their hours are 9-4, quite often they are too busy to take people in by 3. I've spent a lot of time there with my friend and have gotten to know the staff there. They are more than willing to help those who have someone close to them going through addiction and who are just looking for help. I have seen lots of parents come in alone asking about how they can best help their son or daughter, etc. Everyone there is there for help, there's no judgment.

About cost barriers - I've got one friend on income assistance who's treatment was entirely covered and even still got 115 a month. If he wasn't in treatment I believe the fu amount he would have received was 960/mo. I'm so glad our country does this for people. This was for a treatment center called Turning Point. From my interactions as an outsider with the councilors there I would recommend it.

About cost barriers, continued - I have another friend who has been functioning with fent use for quite a while. He admitted to his family that he needed help and would go to treatment. He didn't have the money to pay for it and wasn't eligible for income assistance as he had a job and was making money. His parents didn't want to risk him changing his mind so paid his way into treatment. They accept payment for 15 days at a time, no refund. He stayed 4 days before deciding to leave, cost his parents $4,500. This was for a treatment center called Together We Can. I did not have any personal interactions with the staff there but have a family member who highly recommends it.

Income assistance takes quite a while to go through. Even longer if, say, you've been homeless and have lost all your ID. If you're from out of province and don't have MSP but find yourself here with no way to get home, the medication to help you get off opioids might cost you $30 a day, every day. Again, without ID, a wallet, a job, a place to stay... Now you're either committing crimes to pay for your addiction or committing crimes to pay for your medication. 

Funding solutions and access to solutions will save more money than it costs. We unfortunately have a quantity problem as well as a quality one. Bringing in the best of the best won't help the numbers we need it to. There are certainly some people who will need the best therapy and counseling that money can buy, but the best value for the money is in increasing the amount of people who can be helped. More beds, more clinics, more treatment centers, more doctors, more social workers, etc.

Either you get them help and become a human rights issue going against their will. Or you don't help them and let them die freely.

The reality is the government needs to make a firm decision on what to do with these issues. This type of addiction is a form of mental illness caused by substance. Not everyone has the willpower to decide to get off fentaynl and follow through a program that helps you weed it off.  But there are people who might openly want to be on it. Should the government decide for those people?

That is where we are now. We went towards the ""De-institutional approach"" with many social worker programs and companies where we intergrade mental health patients backing into communities. But it doesn't work for addiction when the entire community is surrounded by addiction.

It is like taking a coke addict and saying to an addict "" Congrats, you have passed the program, now lets lock you into this room full of coke. I hope you don't regress."" That is our program right now. Let people back into the ""community"". Before we can even start with fixing mental health, we need to change the community first.",t3_tmeobe,Drugs or Alcohol

The purpose of this program is to gradually build a life for the addict so they can put something else into that empty glass: a social network, a job, some daily pleasures.  If you can do that, it will mean that even as the heroin drains, you are not left totally empty.  Over time, as your life has more in it, the glass will contain more and more, so it will take less and less heroin to fill it up.

I work in construction. I've seen dozens, if not hundreds, of drug addicts that think they're fine. These are usually people on the downward slope. They make 80 to 100k a year if they manage to show up everyday, but most start missing a day per pay period, then 2 or 3, then a week at a time, then let go or they disapear. Inevitably they come asking for their job back 6 months later as their entire life has fallen apart.

We almost always give them that chance with the understanding they have very little leeway, most dont make it 3 weeks. 

If you talk to them honestly they say they're fine, they don't need or want help (we will try to line up all sorts of things), their drug use is just for fun.

The thing is there are 10s of thousands of casual users that are fine. That go hard on weekends, go to work, have a mortgage, fuck some even have kids and seem to do an ok job there.

But the ones that can't do that, don't, and too much of the time they end up on the street, in a total spiral. I know of one person specifically in this scenario that died this past year. 3 years ago they were a bright outgoing young (25ish) person with their life ahead of them. I saw him 3 months before he died and he was a paranoid fucking wreck of a human.

So what do you do with people that won't take the help, that may even want it, maybe don't even know how  to take the help? Who need a bit firmer hand than hey, stop doing drugs your life will be better. Their brains are altered from prolonged use, they can't delay gratification or resist drugs.

8,5,"I volunteered for about a decade at a second stage housing place, often referred to as a recovery house, which is not a rehab exactly but a place you stay after you get out of detox for free and are trying to stay clean. Most people are allowed to stay for 2-3 months as long as they are participating every day in the mandatory group meetings and are going to Daytox programs, and almost always 12 step meetings at night. They give you a bed and free meals and you're expected to do chores and follow the rules and programs of the house.

 It gives people way more freedom than a treatment centre which is usually what they need, but they often aren't able to stay long enough to get their feet really under them. Most people need time to get their job prospects together and some emotional stability. A lot of that has to do with how long it takes to get access to government programs like disability and housing. Also building a community of other people in recovery to rely on as supports.

These places are often way understaffed and rely on volunteers to do shifts and run groups which is what I did. They have minimal funding and the people that do work there are usually highly educated and severely underpaid. As a volunteer I had no formal training, just an open heart and a lot of free time as well as being clean many years. 

I don't know what the breakdown of all the services in the DTES are, or exactly how it facilitates more people staying homeless and entrenched. But I do know we need way more transitional housing, detox beds and medium term housing for those that actually are trying to claw their way out of the gutter. We are talking about people who have burned every bridge and fucked their health completely but are really trying to stay off the street and stay clean. It just takes time to undo enough damage that they can live sustainably on their own and stay clean. 

All of them have brutal childhood trauma that informs their addictions and so often concurrent mental health illnesses. They need access to trauma therapy and a Psychiatrist the day they leave detox and enter one of these places if they want any chance of staying clean long term. But it often takes months to get access to the right medical support team. Luckily the place I volunteered at did have a Doctor that would visit and see the residents but her caseload was huge and they were there primarily to make sure the residents were getting the right meds. 

Basically it's like trying to raise a child in 4 months. Get them to start taking agency, proper care and ownership of their bodies, their emotions and then get them ready to leave the nest of free housing to live their lives. I think you can see how difficult a challenge that would be even if you weren't addicted to drugs but just had experienced extended homelessness.

Everyone (including people who have no ties to Vancouver) keep demanding Vancouver city council step up and solve these issues with magnitudes more passion than to the Prov/Fed. Hell for a change of pace I'd love to see people from Vancouver start calling in to council meetings in Burnaby, North Van, Surrey, Poco with the same volume Vancouver gets from advocates outside the city.

They could have the option to give them a light sentence and commute it to rehab.

Either way though when people say ""forced rehab doesn't work"" what they actually mean is ""forced rehab has low success rates"". The problem with that logic is that when it comes to meth/herione/fent, everything has a low success rate. That's just how highly addictive drugs are. But any success rate is better than leaving them to abuse themselves on the street until they inevitably die. That's a 0% success rate.",t3_tmeobe,Drugs or Alcohol

Sure, if you take the worst comments on the Vancouver subreddit and then externalize them to the real world.

The vast, vast majority of people who are committing crimes and also have drug addictions have pre-existing records. First we would need to actually punish people for crimes that they commit here, because going to rehab would be much worse than the punishment people generally get for low level crimes here.

See, this is something that is asserted but IMO only targets one niche of user. We have recreational users that one day find themselves in a position where instead of using drugs to have fun, they need drugs to have fun. We have the people who are prescribed pain pills for all variations of ailments and injuries who either get addicted, find their pain lasts longer than their prescriptions and they have to seek illicit sources. We also have the type of user you're talking about. The one who was dealt a shit hand on day 1 and never had a chance. That's why we need a flexible 4 pillars approach. We can't treat every user the same. 

We can talk about late-stage capitalism but I feel simply placating the masses with drugs is a pretty bleak option in itself. I fully support a strong social floor but I think we can get there with improvements to supports (Prov/Fed level). And I certainly don't support a hard reset of the country in a blind hope inequality fixes itself.

For policing - It's nothing if it's not aided by rehabilitation for the individual or 'jailtime' for the public good (dependent on the crime committed). That is my 'but no one seems to want to do anything about Z'. Take the worst 5% of offenders out of the DTES and give prescription narcotics to those who want it and watch the DTES improve overnight. Have BC/Fed get into the housing/landlord business outside of Vancouver and watch the area actually *heal*. We're not even close to these conversation yet though.

And speaking on prevention, we need to have a hard talk on how the DTES is not a place of healing. It's a black hole other municipalities are happy to support so they don't have to kick in supports themselves. Prevention also means preventing people from getting *worse*. That is not how the DTES operates yet people want to keep pushing that idea. For new addicts - I agree we need to try and stop that. 'Don't do drugs' era didn't work.

But if my options for advanced long-term pain management, beyond willpower, are narcotics, alcohol, and cannibas...guess which one is most affordable in BC? 

Dig into it further, and it gets worse. Alcohol goes through your system pretty fast, and it's really hard on you, and it's very expensive in BC; add in the impairment from alcohol, and it's crippling. Cannibas also isn't that cheap, and enough cannibas to really take the edge off of that kind of pain also impairs you significantly. You can't function. 

And then there are narcotics. Yeah, they can make you loopy af if you're trying to get high, but if you're just trying to manage pain, they can take the edge off like nothing else, and you can still mostly function on them.

I watched my 13 year old cousin be administered fentanyl daily for several months when he was suffering through late stage cancer. He usually took his fent in the form of lollipops.

But as I said, fentanyl can be given safely (or as safely as any other opioid) in a medical setting. The key is quality control and consistent dosing.

We can't trust the quality and dosing of something so potent to street level dealers.

We already produce, and legally prescribe fentanyl in the form of pills, skin patches and lollipops to many many patients. All we would need to do is also provide them to addicts, to massively reduce overdose deaths.

First, I want to give you an incredible amount of love, and support. I know what you're going thorugh, and I know how it can destroy your mental health. 

The honest truth is there isn't a good option. I've lost both my best friend and someone I loved to overdose and addiction. The thing I learned is that you can't force someone to get better until they're ready, all you can do is be ready to catch them when they fall.

The only real advice I can offer is don't try and force them, because it won't save them, they'll just turn away from you, and you will no longer be able to offer them support. That will just make them more isolated and more lonely, which makes it more likely that something bad will happen. My biggest (by far) regret in life is that someone I cared for died, and I don't think in the end they knew that they were still loved. 

Be kind, talk with them, offer support, ask them questions, but treat them like a normal person not someone who is sick or needs pity, make sure they know you care. Try and find things you can do together that won't have alcohol or drugs availble. 

I know everything I've written sounds pretty negative, but it's not hopeless, when someone's ready, they'll seek out help, and treatment, just be sure you are able to offer it when they're ready.

Can you talk with him when he is a bit more sober and let him know you are worried he will die? With his breakup triggering relapse he might be doing it to sedate himself from the pain of his feelings. Getting him help for addressing that mental health side can maybe help with convincing him to stay off it.

They get quite busy so you want to get there early, but they are good hearted and a wealth of resources. They got him into a number of shelters and eventually to a treatment center.

Be there for your friend, do NOT give your friend money. Take them out for dinner, grab a slice of pizza with them, whatever. Do human things with them, be their friend, but don't give them money, no matter what their excuse or story is. You will find out, as I did, as so many other people have, that addicts are the best fucking liars out there. 

Be willing to help, but you must be willing to set and stick to boundaries. You will be abused if you don't, and allowing your friend to abuse your good faith does nothing to help him. Help him get to his appointments, to the clinic, to get his scripts filled, etc. Be careful of what you tell him. There was a point where I had to cross my fingers and hope that my friend couldn't remember where I lived. I didn't used to lock my doors, but after this they're locked every day and night. 

If he trusts you, and if you're okay with it, then suggest he put you down as his emergency contact if you think he wouldn't want to have his parents involved.

My point is, it can happen to anyone, and a lot of people look down on addicts in their addicted state without even considering who they are underneath the disease.

So anyone that thinks not becoming an addict is just a no-brainer choice, and that they should be punished for being one, needs to learn a lot more about the science of addiction and even free-will for that matter. The real causes of addiction come from a mix of two variables - Genetics & upbringing + societal and external influences.

8,5,"It has nothing to do with them wanting it. An addiction is controlled by a subconscious impulse for a substance that alters the nervous system and the nervous system starts to be unable to regulate itself without the substance. The desire for the substance is not located in the prefrontal cortex (where rationality and logic resides and actual decision making), it's located in the most primal parts of our brains that we literally do not have influence over and the decisions it makes are not in line with the authentic self of a person that resides in the prefrontal cortex. If their prefrontal cortex is still partially online or sometimes online, it's either you are fighting a constant battle within yourself that takes all your energy all the time and results in other manifestations of mental illness from the shame, or you give in and rationally justify why what is actually your subconscious is making the decisions that it's making, in order to reduce cognitive dissonance. We can't outwill our subconscious over time. There is literally no human with enough conscious 'willpower' to achieve that; the subconscious is so powerful as it's the survival state mechanism in our brains - ironically often causing is to engage in things that will kill us, as it is exclusively concerned with immediate relief/'survival' and not long term impacts.

That is the case for many people who are still functional addicts, that they are able to retain access to their prefrontal cortex at least when not severely high or drunk. But for many people who are severely mentally ill or by the time they live on the streets for example, often their prefrontal cortex is permanently offline and in rare cases may not even be able to be brought back to any degree after extended detox and treatment. Even for those who are able to do so, we can only rewire our programming towards coping with our nervous system states through substance use with extended detox and ideally repetitive and reprogramming exercises and experiences towards new coping mechanisms of regulation so that our subconscious will slowly let go of the positively associated programming that a substance is the only way it can regulate our nervous system or allow us to psychologically 'escape'. This component is both difficult and takes a very long time to do fully and is often missing from current treatment regimens, which is one reason for high relapse rates.

You won't be able to understand it as long as you continue to look at it as a 'want' for that state, because that's not how it works. They may have learned to justify it consciously to escape the cognitive dissonance of constantly being pulled towards and feeling not in control of their own choices or not understanding why they can't seem to think past immediate gratification, but addiction is about strong deep-brain wiring towards a substance as a nervous system alteration/regulation mechanism.

The irony is the psychiatrists think they are triaging, by sending these people out over and over to continuously cycle through ERs and ambulances and jails (and morgues).

8,5,"This is an excellent description of addiction, and I truly appreciate you writing this. You have explained some things clearer than the professionals.

However, I'd just like to clarify: that my description of ""wanting"" comes from my own personal feelings about the situation. No matter how much endless information I consume about addiction (from professionals, from addicts), no matter how much I intellectualize the situation, it is nearly impossible for me to fully understand and make peace with my brother's addictions and ultimately, their deaths. 

On the one hand: my deepest, truest, darkest heart believes that there was no way for my brothers to escape addiction and become sober. I believe that what you have written above does accurately describe them. My brothers started their lives with substances with prescription oxycontin stolen from their friend's dad when they were 14 and 16 years old, and I believe (although I don't exactly know the timeline of things because, as their older sister, I always had my own life and my own focus on things) the descent from there was quick and dramatic. I believe that opiates and stimulants such as crack and cocaine had already overtaken both of their nervous systems before either them even reached the age of 20. I know that it is not *impossible* for someone to overcome an addiction established at such an early age, but . . . improbable? I think so.

On the other hand - as someone with no experience with addiction or self destructive tendencies, as the older sister who grew up in the very same home as them, how can I rectify all this in my mind? We grew up with two parents who loved and supported us 3 fiercely. We had an absolutely idyllic childhood in an upper middle class home, free of any adversity, challenges, mental illnesses or afflictions. Our parents supported our passions and our eccentricities. All three of us were very widely loved and popular in our suburban town. My brothers had nothing to escape. I know some will claim that I simply don't know what my brothers went through - perhaps they suffered abuse or mental illness that I was unaware of. But no, this is not the case. They had every single privilege that a child of the 90s could possibly be afforded in this world, including limitless talent, aptitude, passion, and confidence. These two boys were literally the brightest stars in our whole town, and so many people throughout Alberta and BC would easily agree with this description. But it's better to burn out than to fade away, right? I believe that overtime, and as their addictions worsened, and as they began experiencing the negative results of their addictions (ODs, blood poisoning, infections, heart failure, rejection from family, lack of money, selling off all their things, burning of bridges and lifesavers, witnessing others OD, and the sheer pain of watching their peers succeed at the things they wanted most to succeed at) that the traumas they needed to escape from did develop overtime. 

The fact is that I see my brothers individually as being two different people. Quite frankly, I feel as though that I did not know their addict selves. They protected me against the reality of the situation, as did my parents. I went out and got my own life and I was spared (lied to? I dunno.) having to face what was really going on with them. The three of us went to concerts, we jammed and made music together, watched movies together, listened to podcasts together, chatted online all day every single day, dreamt of our futures and made plans and promises that I didn't know they couldn't keep. My best friend once told me that ""they were sick, and when they were with you, you reminded them of a time when they weren't sick, and they tried their best to keep that alive. You allowed them to remember what it was like before they were sick."" And he was right. It's just that I didn't know really that they were sick. I didn't know. I just thought that they made truly stupid, idiotic, selfish, and unjustifiable choices. And every time I saw them, I would tell them, ""we love you boys, and we just want you to be safe, because what would we do without you?""

And now here we are, without them. I have no siblings. And I have to live my whole entire fucking life this way. And they never got to realize literally any of their dreams. And for what?

. . . I can talk on this subject until the end of time. I just want you to know that when we speak of them ""wanting it"" and when we say things about our loved one's addictions that may sound cold, cruel and callous, it's because we are not speaking from an intellectual standpoint. It is how we feel, and these feelings are absolutely justified. I truly do not mean to be cruel and I certainly do not mean to misrepresent the true nature of addiction. But when you have lost as much as I have in such a way, when your origins were so pure, when your people were so loved, and their futures so bright and full of potential, you don't have time to care about compromised nervous systems and conscious control. My brothers were just so fucking smart, it was unbelievable. And when they were in their teens, they made a stupid fucking choice and I am certain they were addicted from that first imbibement.

If a patient is acutely psychotic and intoxicated, they can be certified temporarily ONLY while still psychotic and a danger to themselves. That first certificate lasts a maximum of 48 hours, but will be lifted early if they no longer meet criteria. Once they come down from their high and are no longer psychotic, they are not certifiable even if they explicitly say that they are going to get high again as soon as they leave. This is based on legal precident, not any individual doctor‚Äôs opinion. In a handful of cases, I would estimate less than 5%, patients are still psychotic after coming down from the high. In that case, their certification can be renewed by a second physician and they would be transferred to psych for further assessment if deemed necessary for either their safety or to allow further assessment and treatment of a primary psychiatric condition.

Prohibition of drugs raises their transport price/overhead exponentially, thus the dealers will then switch to the substances that may be transported in the smallest and most concentrated amounts.

BUT the bad effects you so much more. 3 notable experiences 1. My son gets his driving licence suspended for 6 months, later extended to one year, all from being the sober driver and driving his friends home but the police tested him and found the presence of THC that he had taken about 36 hours previous. What BS. If it's legal, it's legal. They don't test for nicotine.  2. Another boy of mine had to go to court as a minor for apparently saying something offensive to a girl that he knew from high school. In the old days, we said sorry, now the fricken courts deal with it. They wanted a polygraph and said that it would absolutely help solidify his innocence. I checked with a lawyer. He said absolutely DO NOT do the polygraph because they are not admissible in court so the only thing they're used for by the police is to help find guilt by potentially getting a wrong answer to one of their loaded questions in the total absence of proof. Then they use that answer to help build a case against you. I quote the lawyer ""nothing good ever comes from a polygraph"". Police pressured and lied to us and a minor in an attempt to build a case for something the accuser backed out of but the police said they had to investigate.  3. Another sign of the times. I called a little sleaze ball a name. He took me up on charges for ""uttering threats"". Totally trumped up BS accusation by a vindictive little fucker and the police call me and tell me to come down to the police station to file a response and get ""interviewed"" by police. I go down there and sit down and am polite and expect to simply state my side to the equivalent of a playground squabble when the officer tells me for whatever reason that I was lucky he didn't decide to go knock on my door and arrest me in handcuffs in front of my kids because that was in his power to do.

I got pulled over for speeding on my way to Regina from Saskatoon. This was before cops had the right to to issue a roadside sobriety test at any point. I had a little bit of weed in my backpack within the vehicle (technically is supposed to be in the trunk just like alcohol). I don't know if he was actually able to smell it or was just looking for a reason to see if I'm sober. 

I've had my fair share of run ins with the cops and in my experience if you comply and make their life easy they will tend to do the same for you. So after telling me he smells weed I upfront tell him there's weed and alcohol in the vehicle. He asks me to step out and I do as well as move the weed and alcohol to the trunk. We chat for a bit and he gives me the option to swab my mouth for cannabis or refuse and face roadside suspension.

Once again I'm super up front about things and tell him I'm a daily user and had been smoking and drinking pretty heavily the night before. Told him I had a glass of wine with dinner and hadn't smoked in ~16 hours. He assured me that if I was telling the truth I would be completely fine and I would be on my way. 

The test takes quite awhile to collect enough saliva to get a good result and then about 10-15 minutes to come back with a result. This gave us time to chat about all sorts of things including the laws around driving and weed. He explained to me that the roadside saliva test will only be positive at 5 TIMES the concentration at which you are legally considered to be impaired. It's not a very sensitive test at all. 

Don't get me wrong, when I was younger I drove around high a lot. I'm not proud of it and don't drive under the influence anymore. There wasn't all the advertising to say it's just as bad as driving drunk. There also was not a lot of research to support the fact it impairs you. Regardless this province has a problem with impaired driving and is taking steps to really crack down on it. I know it's a bit of pain to wait at the side of the road in a cruiser but we'll all be safer for it.

Cannabis is a legal substance with few known health risks among adults and plenty of medicinal uses, yet it is still treated like a Schedule 1 drug.

1,6,"Not a lawyer but I have looked into this quite a bit. Basically if you use cannabis regularly (like once a week or more), you will constantly be driving ""under the influence"" according to this backwards ass province. 0 tolerance is complete bullshit for a legal substance. 

THC is stored in fat cells. So if you are a regular user, you will have some amount of THC stored all over your body. When you burn fat, like when exercising, it releases that THC into your bloodstream, but never enough for you to actually be impaired by it. The shitty part is that you could stop smoking for a month or more and still have THC show up on a test because of this. Even after using cannabis 1 time, you still might have detectable amounts for several days or even a couple weeks after. 

Personally I think this is borderline entrapment. But unfortunately it's going to take at least a couple peoples lives being ruined over this before someone with the means (money) to properly fight it can prove that this decision is unlawful. Simply having THC detectable does not mean impairment. It's not at all like blood alcohol level. You can't quantify THC impairment. I'm not sure why we are even trying. If the concern is my ability to safely operate a vehicle, then test my ability to do so. What does it matter if I have THC in my system or not if it is known that the presence of THC does not automatically mean impairment?

\-Most importantly, \*DO NOT DRIVE HIGH\* (I know you said you'd never, but I can't emphasize it enough)

The saliva test trip is made to detect the presence of THC. I don't believe that it determines an amount. I have had people very close to me get charged with this exact thing. You do not receive a criminal code conviction for this situation alone. It's a ticket, impoundment of vehicle, and possibly SGI troubles (points off license, mandatory training, additional fines). In order to secure a criminal code conviction, a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) would need to preform some tests on you to determine in their opinion, that you are too intoxicated to operate a motor vehicle. Not all police officers are DRE's and there may not be one on duty or not available to test you.   
\-Speculation: I would think the dispatch of a DRE would be determined by the primary officer's discretion, based on your level of intoxication or any aggravating factors (motor vehicle accident, fleeing, racing).-

It's holiday season, Sask people are dumb and DWI all the time, I get that, the issue is, is this law isn't preventing people DWI, it's preventing people from essentially smoking weed, the thing tredeau allowed to try and make Canada more money. This is going to backfire from both a political, and societal standpoint if it's not reworded into something useful.

The thing is, is I do follow the rules, I am autistic, that's like, one of the few things I do right is follow rules. I haven't driven in awhile because of this, and have NEVER driven high further then moving a car from my driveway. If I get pulled over, even though I haven't felt high in days, let alone smoked, I am screwed. If I get pulled over within the next few days, I am getting a dwi for just the swab, or even after Christmas with blood work. The issue is, they aren't testing to see if you are DWI, they are testing to see if there is ANY thc in your system what so ever, the issue is, thc doesn't just leave the second your high does, it sticks around for awhile after. Thc levels also get different people higher then others. When I was hardcore into weed, I could probably keep up with a lot of the people smoking since before it was legal, meaning 1-2 fat dabs. I could stop for a week, have a single bong rip, stop for another week, and still be fucked per the science they are basing the law on.

It would be like if cops tested for a BAC above 0.0...00001, you're not anywhere near intoxicated, if anything you just have a mild hangover... Except the last time you drank was a week ago, and you get a dwi anyways, worst part, is because it's a drug, you don't get to install a breathalyzer if you wanna drive again. The issue is that weed is legal here in Canada, yet, Sask is the only one to have any law like this, essentially making it illegal if you want to have any semblance of a normal life, while smoking cannabis more then once or twice a year. It's just not possible for anyone to follow these rules and also smoke weed, catch 22 type delema, which is why I, and many others are upset.

in sk (and federally) to get a dui you must test at or over 5ng per ml, this is the current scientifically arrived definition of impairment from recent use. anything over 2ng can lead to a summary conviction, and doesn't need to involve impairment.

current research shows that thc in the bloodstream after smoking levels drop to less than 2ng after 4 hours. saliva tests may be positive anywhere from 24-72 hours, and anecdotal evidence suggests even longer for heavy users.

this is why they don't test everyone who swabs positive for impairment, because they are likely not impaired, and they would be wasting police resources pursuing people for things they wouldnt be able to charge them with. i would like to see a breakdown of everyone who gets their license suspended also getting a blood test.

THC highs last up to 10 hours in most people, but THC is detectable in saliva for 24-48 hours. So someone could have been completely functionally sober for 15 hours and still come up positive in a saliva test. It's even possible to get detectable THC in your system through second hand smoke, so you could break the 0 tolerance without ever having smoked yourself if you happen to be around someone who is.

1. the swab doesn't test for thc, it test for metabolites.

2. in sk to get a dui for cannabis you have to test at or over 5ng of thc per ml of blood. federal laws state 2-5ng can only be considered a summary offence.

3. after smoking thc levels in the blood drop down to under 2ng after 4 hours.

4. testing everyone who tests positive for thc using the swab would not be an effective use of police resources because a good deal of people who test positive for thc using the swab would not have enough thc in their blood to charge them with a dui.

5. government employees often get bonuses or raises for meeting targets. if you grow your department, agency, division you can argue you have more responsibility and deserve more money. this incentive distorts governance. look at alberta, the government has told municipalities it cannot put in speed cameras without scientific evidence that it reduces accidents as well.

6. cops make 30-50k of their salary in overtime. you are going to not be getting overtime if you do not perform your job to the expectations of your superiors. this can incentivize police officers to group-think and conform to unjust applications of their power.

1,6,"Judges are quite reasonable however they also render judgment based on the legal framework and legal arguments relative to that framework.   Making a legal argument isn't the same as a coffee row debate and what might make sense in one of those contexts might not make sense in another.

For example, making an argument of ""I waited some time after consuming THC so I don't believe I was impaired operating the motorcycle"" in this case probably wouldn't be enough to convince a judge that the law wasn't violated because the law sets out some criteria.   You'd need to give the judge a little more to work with in terms of legal arguments.  Remembering that you have reasonable doubt on your side as the defendant, citing accepted or authoritative references that you waited a time that is widely recognized as sufficient would help.  Citing references that call into question the reliability of the testing process.

Drunk drivers don't get off because the judge decides it was okay for the to be driving over the legal limit of .08.  The legal limit has been challenged and has held up in court.  They get off because they're able to convince the judge there is reasonable doubt in the test result.  Same with speeding, if you can show the police officer didn't follow procedures intended to ensure an accurate speed measurement you can create doubt in that particular speed measurement even though such measurements are generally accepted by courts.  THC impairment is a little different than .08 or speed radar in that it hasn't really been challenged in court.  One motorist defending themselves citing some information found via a Google search likely wouldn't be sufficient to make a precedent setting case for the judge to reject the prescribed limits.",t3_17fc3gz,Drugs or Alcohol

Also, the apartment owners managed to make it that by default, it's illegal to smoke in rented units/apartments/etc... So unless you own a house, or have a good friend at which you can go smoke (with written consent), it's completely illegal to smoke weed anywhere.

Oh... also, having a medical prescription for it doesn't shield you from those fines. Sure there's been some that contested that in court and won, but you still get the fine and need to take it to court every fucking time.

It's ridiculous. Before leg, worse case you'd get a patdown and they'd seize your shit and be told to be on your way (unless you had a quantity that classified you as a dealer)... most of the time you'd just be told to botch it and gtfo... now, it's a risky adventure every fucking time.",t3_18t2vgy,Drugs or Alcohol

The cannabis law act is federal level, so once it passed (despite the protests of some provinces), the provinces had to conform to it. While provinces cannot change the laws, the provincial governments and even cities have a lot of options about ADDING their own rules/bylaws. They cannot make it ""illegal"" but they can fine for just about w/e and change come parameters.

For instance, the canadian law allows for 4 plants to be grown. That number can be reduced by the provincial government, but they cannot ignore/cancel the law. The Quebec government used a loophole and just set the limit to 0 in Quebec, making it illegal to grow weed for personal/recreational use, despite the canadian law's spirit.

2,6,"Yes, the whole law system for medical cannabis is a parallel system that was implanted many years before recreational marijuana was legalized and they kind of kept the two systems pretty distinct.

That said, where you can legally smoked is being abused by the police a lot, they'll still give you the fine and let you go to court to sort it out (unless you're specifically trying to be obtuse about where to use it, it's generally dismissed easily, but still a major pain in the butt for those who get the fine). I'm not 100% sure on where it's allowed medically (since we're talking apartments/condos/housing, it might or might not apply to them, not sure).

- it‚Äôs not unusual for a lease not to include appliances like stove and fridge and to be expected to bring your own (though it‚Äôs common enough also for them to be included, the key is making sure you‚Äôre ready for what you get yourself into)

- after the first year of an annual lease, instead of being able to terminate at any time with notice, leases automatically renew for a full year (typically but not necessarily on July 1) ‚Äî there‚Äôs room to negotiate with the landlord and/or you can transfer the lease to another tenant if you need to move mid-year but this is a complication to know about.

- Newer-build condo-style apartments typically have A/C but generally in all the older charming triplexes you need a window unit (or to suffer through awful summer heat)

- Language politics in some onljne spaces is really toxic and in day to say life you‚Äôll probably encounter some assholes from time to time who give you a hard time about an English accent and/or speaking English, but the vast majority of people are kind and welcoming, especially if it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre making an effort to learn and speak French.

I'll be going in early October (only time we can get away with summer holidays already planned out) and I bet it will be just right for that kind of tour of the city. Big in Japan sounds *amazing.* That's a spot-on recommendation for us. 

That's funny about the AC. I lived in a place with no central air awhile back and did the exact thing with the Delonghi floor standing AC. Put it right in the bedroom next to by bed so at least I could sleep at night. The building you live in makes a difference too. In Toronto, I recently lives in a very nice high-rise where you were ROASTING from May through September. Didn't matter if it was only 20 degrees outside, it would be pushing 30 or worse inside and the ventilation was so poor. Without AC you were doomed. Now, in a north-facing townhouse, I only use AC occasionally, even on very hot days. 

Regarding French, I will just do my best to learn, which I am excited to do. I'll just put myself out there and try speaking French and trust that the person I'm chatting with will take it in good spirit. 

**I do have a question about culture.** What is the ""after work"" culture like? Is it common from colleagues to go out and socialize? One thing about Toronto, especially post-pandemic, is that colleagues, though perfectly friend, are quick to head home at the end of the day.

I actually grew up in the USA, though I am a Canadian citizen and I've lived here since I was 18 (so, 20 years). However, this meant that I was really removed from the French language. In my school, in a very rural part of the West, learning a second language just wasn't something people did. The language classes in HS were largely a joke and French wasn't even offered.

Canadian Prime Ministers are just the leaders of the governing party, and they get only one vote in Parliament, just like every other MP.


American Presidents are also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, and any idiot in charge can order misguided, opportunistic military action without the backing of Congress (see: Iraq II). In Canada, the Commander-in-Chief role is ceremonial, and the title belongs to the Governor General.


I find a lot of the political toxicity here lately (and the ""f*CK Trudeau"" dipshits) is the direct result of people thinking Trudeau has the same kind of powers as a US president, which is simply not true. Canada has one of the most decentralized governments in the western world. The sheer number of idiots who blamed him for provincial mask mandates alone...ugh. You'd think those who criticize the government the most would actually bother to learn how it works before opening their mouths.

Edit: And fwiw, I much prefer the Canadian system. For as much as Americans scream about the concept of ""state rights"", Canada's got them beat.

3,6,"In all the years I lived in Toronto (Roncy Village) I never - I repeat never - locked up until I came home one day to a raccoon in my apartment; I couldn't figure out how it got in until I found a torn window screen. The raccoon found the bags of dog and cat food in the kitchen and after that it was a battle to keep it out of my home. I called Animal Control for help, and they wished me luck. From that day forward I kept my apartment doors and windows locked up but still had to periodically escort the bugger out with a broom at its butt. My cat and dog were very much passive observers, to my frustration. I even found my cat and the raccoon sitting side-by-side on the porch railing one night.

My last sight of the raccoon was in late spring one year just before I moved (but not because of the raccoon LOL). I watched the racoon try to teach her two babies how to open the sliding glass door to the living room, while my dog and cat sat inside also observing proceedings. She was really persistent, even when it was clear I had already outsmarted her with a piece of wood in the track to stop the door from sliding.  Me banging on the glass and cussing her out didn't phase her at all, she just looked insulted and slowly waddled off in a huff with her babies in tow.

I hear some rattling noise and then crunching sounds. 

A couple of these little trash pandas had such around behind us and were chowing down on the dogs kibble.

My Pyr doesn't care about little animals at all. We were sitting out while camping one time, and I was feeding peanuts to some chipmunks. These little guys were bombing back and forth with full mouths going to store away their nuts.

But if your favourite street has 10 liquor stores and 8 pot shops that have managed to stay open, it‚Äôs because there are that many alcoholics and stoners frequenting said street and you‚Äôre in the minority for what you want out of it. It‚Äôs basic supply and demand; if there is more supply than demand, the businesses will close because they‚Äôre not making sales. If there is more demand than supply, more businesses will open because people see they can make the sales. Eventually an inertia is reached that should balance out the areas general supply and demand.",t3_uimo7h,Drugs or Alcohol

First, we've got the whole Smart Serve mentality - if someone is inebriated, you stop serving them.  Being high AF can be considered inebriated, and getting high can only take one joint, depending on the person.  There is no good test of marijuana inebriation.  So you've got to cut people off pretty early.

Second, it is not safe or appropriate to let people who are high AF get in a car, leave, etc, if you can avoid it.  The establishment cannot lock them in, but the location needs to be super careful about letting people drive after getting high, as they may be legally responsible for the outcome.

Third, money, money, money.  One joint and an hour wait requires an influx of cash.  The obvious paring here is food, but we end up with the restaurant problem - restaurants make a significant amount of their revenue off of alcohol sales, not food sales.  If you're selling pot and food, either the pot or the food will have to be expensive to afford the rent.  Or you serve booze *as well*, which enters a very dicey space.

Fourth, edibles.  If we go with the edibles route, your patron may have an hour or two before they feel the effects, then an hour or more of the experience.  Is the intent for people to show up, hang out for an hour, spend an hour or more (probably more) being high AF giggling at cartoons, then leave?  Or is it to pop a few edibles and then go out into the world and see where the wind takes you?

Fifth, indoor smoking.  We've got some rules about that.

Sixth, demand.  Is there actually a demand for this?  I've been out and about, and most people seem content to smoke a joint on the sidewalk, then go back into a bar or restaurant.  The people that want to sit around and get high, stay home.  I've yet to hear anyone seriously pull for a pot-bar.  Is there demand for this?

Fair, though I'd say that's more of a Canadians in general thing, not a Nova Scotians thing. Other provinces are far less prohibitive. When I lived out west I worked in the restaurant industry, so late nights. If I worked say 5-1, and had no booze at home, I'd just pick some up after work if I felt like it, which a lot of the time I didn't bother. When I moved here, I'd never be off work before the liquor store closed, so I'd make sure to pick up before work, which meant I was always stocked.

6,6,"Alright,  time for an update.

I lost one plant to a wayward goat. Hurricane Ian messed up the remaining so yields were bad and quality took a hit for sure. 

 The cherry fritter licker had a fair taste and ok buzz. Yield was ok it definitely feels like fluffier weed, light and airy buds. I was going to write it off, however it produced some fair yield of high quality bubble hash. Great Terps and oily hash. On that alone I would still say pass as the yield is too low.

The GMO was purple and looks great and crystal was plenty. I was quite confused as a lot of places identify it as a more savory strain and the pheno I got is quite perfumy, like a lilac violet mix. The smell is great, the taste is great, the buzz is good. I would recommend it for sure. 

The lesson I learned this year however is the importance of a taproot. I had bad luck with seeds hence buying the clones. The seed I had left is 34 street pink lemonade. Poor thing was in bad shape, when I transplanted it next to the GMO outdoors early June it was maybe a fifth the size. By mid July it had matched both clone varieties. By September it was near 50% bigger; However it was so big that Hurricane Ian broke 80% of it sadly. 

Therefore if you want to grow giant bushes you need seeds, but if you want a uniform plant that maxes out around 4-5 feet clones are fine, 

Next year, I am going with 34 st seed dessert pack in 3x3x4 mobile planting box and when hurricane season happens I will use a dolly and some hay bale netting to safely move them indoors when necessary. I hope to get some fat bushes to make more bubble.",t3_11uo5tb,Drugs or Alcohol

Dear Minister,

As a retired military veteran and cannabis user I would like to point out the one problem I have with Manitoba‚Äôs laws on cannabis. Right now, Manitoba is one of only two provinces who don‚Äôt allow their citizens to grow the 4 plants for personal use that all of the other provinces and territories allow.

I think, if anything, the last 5+ years of legal cannabis has shown that it has not become a societal problem and that the provinces who do allow growing at home don‚Äôt have any more issues than the provinces that don‚Äôt and that the provincial political parties who believed this were mistaken.

Last year was the first time in my life I ever contributed to a political party, your party, because it was apparent that the other parties in Manitoba, including the one in power, had no real solutions for Manitoba‚Äôs problems.

I realize that next to something like Healthcare in Manitoba, this is a very small irritation, but I think it‚Äôs a small gesture Manitoba could do to help cannabis users and help the province line up with cannabis laws nationally. It would also boost the home grower suppliers here.

Yours truly,

You're absolutely right it's illegal especially in a caregiving facility for minors. Not arguing otherwise.

What's worse, ten kids smoking weed, or one kid smoking meth?

I do love 420, been going since I was 13. It‚Äôs a special place for me because when I was 15 and 16 I went with my nana and great grandma, and they‚Äôve both since passed away. We had a great time! My nana didn‚Äôt smoke (well, she smoked hash I made her when she got cancer) but stopped everywhere to ask about little gadgets and edibles and tell everyone how much her grandson, me, loved pot even though I looked about 12 years old lol. 

My great grandma was a tiny 4‚Äô7‚Äù 80 year old quebecois woman and she had arthritis and essential tremors she was using cannabis for. Damn man the cookies she made were so strong. We didn‚Äôt know she was taking them, so for a good month we thought she had dementia because we would say something to her and she would just laugh. Then we discovered the cookies. She was so high she was dragging her knuckles across the coffee table lmao. My uncle tried a third of a cookie‚Ä¶ said he was uncomfortably stoned for 10 hours. 

Anyways my great grandma went around buying edibles and all these people selling were so concerned thinking she didn‚Äôt know why had weed in them. Had to explain so many times and then they were always like ‚Äòright on man!‚Äô Trying to fist bump her lol she was so very confused. I miss them both. My grandma was a feisty, tough old lady.

420 is one of the last places I got to go with my nana before the cancer got too bad for her to do much more. That was tough. We went everywhere when I was little.

2. The levels in your system can be above our legal threshold for almost a week after last use for regular users.

Being the default social exercise, and also the default way people destroy themselves because they're not dealing with their shit is a hard thing to compare reasonably.

The average person in BC over the age of 15 has 534 ""Standard Drinks"" per year, including non-drinkers. I honestly have no idea what ""the frequency that most people drink, but LSD"" would do.

Speed is an upper. It doesn't change your inhibitions. Think of it like coffee. Coffee make you want to beat your spouse?

ADHD medications are exactly like speed. They're literally the same drug. If you get prescribed meds for ADHD in BC, you are likely to get prescribed Dexedrine, which is dextroamphetamine. That's speed. It's functionally extremely similar to meth, too. The methyl group allows easier passage past the blood brain barrier but the major difference between someone with ADHD and a meth addict is dosage. The difference is people with ADHD are taking 30x less.

So unless it's like...Vyvanse (amphetamine with a lysine on it, which has to be removed by your liver before it takes effect, and your liver can only do it so fast), when you're talking about legalizing access to amphetamines, which are extremely addictive, you're talking about opening up the effects of high dose amphetamines, not ""like coffee"", like meth heads. Who have a *very real likelihood* of literally going insane because of stimulant psychosis as well as a whole host of other problems because dose matters a whole hell of a lot.

I am absolutely saying that giving people legal access to recreational amounts of amphetamines is potentially worse than alcohol.

Now with legalization and even society as a whole being more honest about drug and alcohol use, and even experimenting for medical and therapeutic use of typically considered recreation drugs, I would say what matters more in terms of being considered a negative is usage by ""kids"" under 19, and using when working/driving/""responsible adult time"" .

Going to add that since legalization there have been a ton of news reports of pet dogs eating discarded roaches and getting concerning symptoms like Urinary incontinence, Unable to walk/stand, Wobbling, Whining and Fatigue. It usually ends up with panicked owners rushing their pets into a vets office and $1000 later finding out their dog was just overly high and feeling like crap for hours.

It happened to my dog 3 times when he was very young. Poor guy really hated it. Hopefully he has figured out that is what was making him feel bad because he hasn't eaten the last few roaches that he found. Just picks them up and drops them - and I toss them in the trash.

All this to say: please don't treat your roaches like people treat their cigarette butts.

I'll give a personal one. There are always going to be exceptions, and I know a lot of them. That being said, alcoholics and people who make smoking weed their main identifier are both equally shitty in their own ways.

Alcoholics are more obvious, absolute stoners are more stealthily shit. Again, there are people who drink a lot and people who smoke a lot that don't really have any impact on their lives, and this isn't about them. But I feel like with smoking weed being ""cool"" before it was legal, and then it being legal so it was okay, it and it's hardest imbibers got a free pass. If you said anything before it was ""fuck you, it should be legal anyways, bootlicker"" and if you say anything now it's ""fuck you, it's legal now, get off my back!""

I know they aren't completely overlapping, but there's enough of a correlation that it's worth mentioning- I've managed my personal relationships much better after accepting that for the most part hippys are bad people pretending to be good.

This extends to the type of people who seems to (to me, this is just an anecdote) identify with weed the most.

I really don't give a shit if you smoke. I think most people could care less because everyone has known so many do it already, before it was legal. That being said, just don't be ""that guy"" who tries to convince people who choose not to smoke that they just haven't tried the right strain.

Offer me a toke, I appreciate the thought, but just please leave it at that when I say no. Don't smoke in my house without asking, don't even vape in my house without asking, wtf.

Is that term really all that appropriate in this specific situation though?

It seems like the bulk of the shortages the public has experienced are due to the *government's* decision to serve the sector mostly through a government monopoly.

To take the marijuana sector for instance, it would seem like all the shops in Vancouver that sell marijuana are *forced* to buy from a single monopolist provider... which in turn is run by a single union... and therefore, it's like a *government-created* critical bottleneck in the supply chain.

While perhaps other parts in our economy are more fitting of your label, I really don't think *this current situation* is a very good candidate.

And on those online distributors that are black market - why does our government and police allow them to exist in such broad daylight? When it would be very easy to locate them (ie. you can buy through them), and also that it's a bit unfair to force all the legal places to pay big fees and work with a monopolist but then to allow these other places to not only dodge fees but to also have more freedom on their supply chain decisions?",t3_x1plkd,Drugs or Alcohol

>The one I order from changes its website when it gets compromised and when you order for mail-out, the mailing address is a front or dummy address and not where the actual business is.

Fair enough - I can see how simply ordering it through the mail means one could put a dummy address on the package.

>Plus nothing is stopping these guys from collapsing their business to open a new one with a new website.

Wouldn't that actually hurt their business substantially? Like the one I linked to has a website with a phone number - if they're unlicensed, couldn't law enforcement shut down that phone number and the website and then it would be hard for them to simply set it all up elsewhere on a new website and new phone number? Like it would probably be tough to contact your customers and be like, ""we used to be called W at website X... we are now called Y though and our website is Z""? 

>There are no more walk in black market shops as far as I know, since Blue Door was shut down, so it's all online. So much harder to track

I don't quite get why it's *that* hard to track... I mean people can contact these places and literally have someone associated with the company show up in person to make the delivery.

Approach it with much less government Interference.

Two, a comment on just the ""culture"" around legal weed. I was born and raised out East, and the difference between the ""consumer experience"" is insane.

2,7,"The primary principle of first aid emphasizes the importance of the responder's safety. Engaging in first aid that results in harm to oneself defeats the purpose, as it potentially increases the number of victims needing assistance. In certain dire situations, this might mean having to make the difficult decision to not intervene if it compromises one's safety, acknowledging the stark reality that it could result in a fatality. This is a matter of judgment. It's important to note that calling emergency services (911) is considered a form of assistance under the Good Samaritan law.

However, administering Naloxone to someone experiencing a severe reaction to heroin can be a complex situation. Naloxone rapidly reverses the effects of the overdose, which can be a shock to the individual who may not realize they were in life-threatening danger. This sudden withdrawal from the drug's effects can lead to aggressive behavior towards the responder, as the individual might be disoriented and upset. It's not rare for the person being aided to become confrontational. Even if the individual seems physically weakened, they can still pose a significant threat. Therefore, it's crucial to administer Naloxone with a clear understanding of these risks. In cases where the individual is somewhat responsive, especially in areas known for quick emergency response times, calling 911 might be the safer option, as paramedics are equipped to handle such emergencies efficiently.

I‚Äôve administered Naloxone multiple times in my line of work and you‚Äôre completely correct about the patients waking up agitated, however you should 110% administer the Naloxone if you‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs an opioid overdose.  Just administer and then back off if you‚Äôre scared you‚Äôll get stabbed by a needle (highly unlikely).  Even if it‚Äôs not an opioid overdose, Naloxone in itself will not cause any harm to the patient (except it might send them straight into PAWS).  This being said, I think the most dangerous part of administering Naloxone to someone who overdosed on the street is actually getting close to the patient without yourself stepping on his or her needle.  Make sure you approach safely, administer, and then step away and watch from afar if you‚Äôre scared for your safety.  Don‚Äôt forget to call 911 as when the Naloxone wears off (30 to 90 minutes) the patient might (and will likely) fall back into overdose as the opioids take back the receptors that were blocked by Naloxone.

decriminalization isn't going to change the average user. Its not going to magically make them more aware of their surroundings and stop using on the corner. 

It's also not going to magically make every drug user come out of hiding and use in front of your kids school. 

what it does do, is changes how people, and specifically the government, views drug use. Right now its illegal. So if your a user caught in a tussle with another user and you get arrested, you have a possession charge added to your crime. Thats longer time in jail, or more importantly, thats something that shows on a police check. Oh, what if you got out of jail, and chose to go to rehab, go to school to become a child social service worker? good luck passing that police check. an assault charge? maybe sure. Not a possession charge, thats for sure. You can bring up the willingness of other folks to destigmatize drug use, by removing it from being a legal issue, and all of a sudden more people are willing to help. Could mention how many people would not call an ambulance due to OD's because of fear of going to jail (in before ""The ambulance doesn't take you to jail"" - cops come and they are hella pushy).

Thats only the small bit of the 'personal' side- we **know** criminalization of drugs doesn't work, and overall has been used as a systematic way to oppress. 

whats **more** important though, is the way that drug use and safety is viewed by government bodies. For multiple years there was push back against SIS (safe injection sites) because there was red tape around them due to drug use being *illegal*. For years SIS across the country were working on rogue community basis. Under the radar to try and keep people alive. There was massive amounts of pushback against them because drug use was *illegal*. This would open up for bureaucracy shit to actually start getting passed. things like; Longer hours of SIS, more funding for SIS, more funding for public Rehab centers that may not follow the same rehab structures we currently have in place, higher wages for people who work as front line workers that deal with users, ect.

Alcohol is legal and yet there are still many many people in the city who end up in the ER for alcohol related issues. In fact, in my experience working in mental health addictions, the clients addicted to alcohol were much more likely to end up in hospital than the clients addicted to opioids.

We need more funding for harm reduction programs and I don‚Äôt mean more safe injection sites. I mean more outreach programs where people can connect with a case worker who specializes in addiction counselling and will help connect them to needed supports like affordable housing (which we need more of), outreach primary health care that will do home and community visits (like Nurse Practitioners and Physicians who can assess clients outside of a clinic when necessary), more collaboration with the EMS (there is already a program where EMS will refer clients with several ER visits to community programs but ideally having a social worker or case manager work on this EMS team for more efficient care). We need crisis teams that stay involved for longer than 6 - 12 weeks and we need less criteria for intensive support. Right now, in order to get connected to an intensive case management outreach team for mental health you need a min number of psych related hospital visits and still the the wait for this team is 10 months to 1 year.

3,7,"This is actually not true but a common misconception- most crime is relegated to non users except petty crime. The FUNDING of organized crime VIA DRUGS is the issue and they still didn‚Äôt solve that when they legalized even marijuana cause they did it dumb, and coke used to be responsible for more funding than opioids, and now frankly most opioids are not coming from Mexico they‚Äôre coming from the golden circles and triangles for heroin but real heroin is basically extinct in North America it‚Äôs nearly all fentanyl analogues that can be made in a lab starting with ‚Äúkeep an eye on it‚Äù style chemical precursors and the like. You can order it to your fucking house in the Mail. The actual extent of misinformation is shocking.

Real violent crime tends to be among gangs, criminal organizations and higher level dealers and I doubt it would be as pronounced if they didn‚Äôt feel the cops were going to be shooting at them. The only time I ever saw a gun back then, before university and becoming a clinician- was the cops pointing it at me and I didn‚Äôt have any drugs on me. I was standing next to a known dealer but he didn‚Äôt have anything either.

The real solution is taking away the end user an that only happens with science and compassion, and redirection of funding to appropriate places that are indicated by both science and irl practice,

Places that have decriminalized and legalized, they have all found REDUCTIONS in use. Prompt ones. Particularly those that provide psy treatment for the nearly- always -present comorbid primary disorder that underlies and leads to drug use to begin with. People don‚Äôt like using drugs. They don‚Äôt get high just well off opioids when addicts. It‚Äôs like well, do I have the flu today so bad im about to puke and Shit, or do I spend 40-100$ TO NOT HAVE IT. 

Not to mention feel impending doom panic fear terror and extreme depression and sadness among others. It feels like your skin is lit on fire in the worst of it, I can‚Äôt imagine you have anything to compare that to that you can pay to avoid on the daily? Didnt think it was very likely 

Fuck. They hate it. So ya, when like some countries they‚Äôre offered a place to get clean, a job / (most importantly = ‚Äúsomething to live for‚Äù, or education, lots of them want to help others, they tend to be sensitive and actually tend to have a higher intelligence level when clean compared to the average population tho I‚Äôm sure that correlation would IRK THE FCK out of some people cause god forbid an addict could possibly do anything better than them as if they‚Äôre not even people. 

Might as well lock up people who get diabetes or cancer if you follow some of the less intelligent - informed by word of mouth or Non scientific articles/anti empiricism- logic I‚Äôve seen others spout.

Now I can‚Äôt even cause I studied this for 17 years - almost 8 of which are at utoronto and later, clinical
School, to practice. I was an addict for 7 of those years and yes I studied it at the same time and I survived a lot of the time, nearly three times the length of the average end stage user, because I knew the science. 

I have also probably directly saved 50 overdoses cause of being present, and carrying narcan vials/cpr until ambulance - which works well cuz unless you directly cause death via a secondary mechanism like heart attack- the way opioids usually kill by OD is they suppress breathing first, then later heart pumping - automatic functions found near the brains stem/cerebellum. It‚Äôs like your brain forgetting to breathe and pump blood. So breathing O2 into them, and pumping the heart artificially, mostly the former, is z actually incredibly effective to keep them alive til paramedics come with the antidote naloxone. 

or using buprenorphine/naloxone mix ...

(its mostly bupe) (aka suboxone) (I don‚Äôt recommend the latter, you need to understand why - I just know that the science implies because of ‚Äúbinding affinity‚Äù (Google it lol it‚Äôs a basic term) ...

...that the Naloxone and actually also the ‚Äúbupe‚Äù if you happen to have extreme tolerance because of its ceiling effect when converting to norbupe in the organ system, which can only be done at a certain rate (if you understand codeine ‚Äî> morphine it is similar conversion logic for the last 10 words or so before the bracket) but to use this last method you need to know the length of the persons use, average dose, half lives, binding affinities, dosing, and a whole bunch of other shit. 

Dont try it as a sub-stitute (lol A pun!!!!). Ahaha but it personally saved my life twice and of course I didn‚Äôt KNOW if it would work in empirical practice but I HYPOTHETICALLY thought it would it was all hard logic (doesnt mean it will work for you. Lots of variables- just have a narcan babysitter- you‚Äôll be unconscious snd not breathing so you won‚Äôt be injecting the antidote yourself), it‚Äôs all I had that had that kind of effect- even a stimulant would help but I didn‚Äôt take those I didn‚Äôt even smoke weed lol, I used to like weed tho, and  I have given people permission to put it under tongue or inject it if I go unconscious - I always back then - and so should you! - have a babysitter even if it‚Äôs another user we take turns making sure people don‚Äôt die. Never not test new batches because MICROGRAMS can kill even a seasoned user. 

also fill out your medical info on your phone, or put something in your wallet, it‚Äôs the first thing people check!

I have watched enough people I‚Äôve heard of, and direct friends and anyone from long term, single day, non using bystanders, people who used for a year BURIEd DEAD (or three months or 10 years, or any period!) so fuck. It‚Äôs no joke. 

I have absolute distaste for anyone who spouts shit without knowing anything. Fucking internet Jesus

I mean. If you can not easily understand this ans also figure out why the logic makes sense then please god don‚Äôt ever come near this, as if just death wasn‚Äôt enough of a deterrent without this warning but usually people on it are at least para-suicidal if not straight up.

3,7,"I've been an addict since I was 11, started shooting dope at 17. Literally the majority of my life I've been a slave to this shit. The best thing that ever happened to me was when things got so fucking miserable and dangerous that I had to stop. The worst times in my life were the times where, whether due to having loads of money and easy access and/or prescriptions to my drugs of choice, I had all the dope I wanted. It was hell, every second was hell. I don't care what junkies say they want, because they don't know what they want. Their minds are fucked up and clouded beyond any semblance of functionality. Literally any addict whose been clean for more than a few months will tell you that.

If I was able to drive down the street and buy dope, my life would be *over*. It'd be done. First because, as an addict, it doesn't matter how pure or clean the dope is. It's never enough. So I end up keep using until I OD or go into psychosis anyway. Then, very soon you hit the point where you get sick as fuck unless you jam a needle into your arm (or hands, or feet, or neck) every few hours. Now you're unable to enjoy life unless you shoot up...actually that's wrong. You're unable to not suffer every second unless you shoot up.

The same goes for quite literally every addict and recovering addict I know, and I know probably a few hundred. That's no way to live, and we should not be encouraging or enabling it.

As for disease, risks of OD, and violence, yeah they exist. I personally know about 15 people who have died because of their involvement in the scene, whether it be ODs, suicide, Hep C, or shootings, many of them good friends. 7 in the past 18 months alone.

I think it should be decriminalized, but I think that alone is not going to reduce the overdoses. People also overdose on alcohol all the time and again that‚Äôs legal. Decriminalization plus better support for people is more likely to lead to less drug use.

Also, the clients I have who use opioids do it either at home, at someone else‚Äôs home, or behind a building somewhere where cops don‚Äôt see them. Sometimes cops do see them and don‚Äôt stop. I have seen cops drive by Dundas east of Jarvis and not stop people openly smoking crack. 

It‚Äôs when someone is acting up that the cops notice. They don‚Äôt randomly stop someone who looks high and check them for drugs unless that person is doing something like destroying property or acting out in some other dangerous way.

It may as well be decriminalized because the enforcement doesn‚Äôt seem to be that strict anyway. And throwing them in jail won‚Äôt solve long standing issues that lead to the addiction in the first place.

Everytime she comes out of the hospital, she‚Äôs in good shape and swiftly spirals again. She needs to be kept in there long enough that she can be fully rehabbed. Clearly the hospital stay helps her but sending her back home just restarts the clock until the next trip to the ER. 

The spiral of addiction is killing me and my family and our current system does literally *nothing* other than slap bandaids on the problem without ever offering proper support.

3,7,"Honestly this is SUCH a long answer question I can‚Äôt even begin. But I‚Äôll give you some neurosci some psy and some personal 

But treating the underlying causes of addiction is the most important. Addiction is usually (read basically nearly never- but any good person in medicine knows not to use the word never in a situation like this because of course there‚Äôs gonna be a rare outlier or few somewhere in the many thousands of people documented, studied, etc but this also lines up with my personal experience in life with myself and other addicts, in recovery communities, and in clinical psy) a SECONDARY psychopathology which means it‚Äôs comorbid WITH some other initial preexisting pathology like say, major depression or BPD, or pick any constellation of symptoms that fall under pathological diagnoses in the DSM

So basically you need to treat that initial constellation of symptoms that make a persons life shit that led to them self medicating to begin with

Trouble is once your brain changes (see: -Google it- neuroplasticity) in the *midbrain<‚Äî>forebrain connections* and in *reward reciprocal feedback loops,* it becomes VERY hard to change especially if the DOC (drug of choice) is PHYSICALLY dependence forming and not just psychological (see: mu agonists/ opioids, gaba agonists: drugs like alcohol benzos, pregabalin/gabapentin, ghb, whatever there‚Äôs a whole host of these Google it) the withdrawal could actually kill you if it‚Äôs a gaba drug, unlikely if it‚Äôs a mu drug except in extreme cases and usually it‚Äôs a secondary failure like heart or something due to the physical stress of withdrawal that are norm particularly if u have a weak heart

Like say, blood pressure spikes that create hot cold feelings and contribute to in-brain *physical* withdrawal when your empty upregulated receptors are starving of whatever substance it is ( I said *physical* cause physical dependence forming drug withdrawal in the brain creates a psych and physical effect. 

Both of which SUCK, as I‚Äôve personally experienced them Hundreds of times and it lasts a week to three weeks depending on the half life of the DOC and length of regular use, dose has some contribution but mostly regulates the eventual severity of the low to high points of the withdrawal‚Ä¶ someone on 200mg Iv morphine for a year daily is gonna be WAY sicker than a Dude taking oral Percocet 5x a day‚Ä¶ wayyyyy sicker. And it just gets worse from the former example honestly that‚Äôs not even a scary high dosage considering the fentanyl analogues on the street now) 

It‚Äôs not just a crisis of character. The changes in your brain mean that your midbrain that controls core drives like food and sex and Also *drug seeking/using* overpower your FOREbrain PFC area aka ‚Äúthe seat of consciousness‚Äù or rational thought. Any conscious thought you have, it‚Äôs there. Drug dependence (particularly gaba/opioids(mu)/dopamine agonists) - to some extent ALL drugs-  in the brain *erodes the braking system that stops you acting on behavioural impulses from your midbrain without thinking.* 

Example: you‚Äôre horny= drive for sex from midbrain. Usually if you see a hot boy or girl on the street you‚Äôre not gonna rape them- why? Forebrain. Rational thought. Eg thought process= Potential for jail, rape hurts people and you don‚Äôt wanna hurt people, there are socially acceptable and appropriate outlets for your desires you can access at a later time to take care of your need. So your midbrain and forebrain usually have a bit of a conversation to find an acceptable solution for your drive. 

In addiction where that connection or forebrain element doesn‚Äôt act as a STOP power on the midbrain as effectively and even less effectively the longer u use, you literally cannot choose because choice requires will which requires conscious thought overpowering drive which is the EXACT THING THAT THE DRUG CHANGES IN THE BRAIN. Or one of many things it changes I should say. So these people are the same people they were before addiction ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre just kind of, autopiloted without any impulse control. But they still feel everything and that‚Äôs why when the conscious mind does get a chance to say something they see all the destruction to them self, their life, family - finances whatever it is, friends gone. 


 there‚Äôs not a lot of reasons to not want to OBLITERATE that kind of pain if you can. And they can. At least while the drugs work. Over time they stop working so well at this so they get more and more miserable, more and more
Physically dependent. It just gets worse and worse until immediate death is honestly preferable. 


So .. that little neuro lesson‚Ä¶..basically the upshot of it all is: it means you (the addict) don‚Äôt get a choice a lot of the time (as to whether you use or not). Because your higher thinking areas don‚Äôt even WORK

there‚Äôs a plethora of studies on dysconnectivity between the mid and fore brain - particularly the PFC (pre frontal cortex ) area of course - which is specifically referred to ‚Ä¶.to put it exceedingly simply ‚Ä¶.as the conscious thought area. I wrote a final paper on it as it was of personal interest and I found SO many I didn‚Äôt need to look far to get even meta analyses upon meta analyses of studies that look at this specifically (a meta analysis is a study that amalgamates data from other studies to create a broader and higher number of subjects / patients picture of what‚Äôs going on so you‚Äôre looking at thousands and thousands of amalgamated fMRI data studies on long term addicts‚Ä¶ meta analysES is thus just the plural form) and id use, also, single ‚Äúusual‚Äù research studies alongside as particular points of interest in a paper. I dunno how into science you are so I‚Äôm just phrasing assuming no sciences above high school. Just trying to make it readable for literally anyone if they use Google.

Most addicts are parasuicidal. Meaning they‚Äôre not fully ‚Äúsuicidal‚Äù or maybe scared but want to die, but usually they don‚Äôt want to live if that makes sense. 


Parasuicidal means killing yourself with high risk behaviours you know have a good chance of killing you and not caring, and sometimes kinda trying to die (using too much and you fkin damn well know it is too much for you, etc) ‚Ä¶ so that‚Äôs the kind of ‚Äúhope ‚Äú for life these people have. Very little to none. They‚Äôre beaten down and often feel they can‚Äôt overcome the addiction anyway which is sadly true. Permanent Recovery rates over life term are UNDER FIVE PERCENT with good treatment tho of COURSE good treatment and support does give you a better chance IF YOU WANT TO GET CLEAN. 

No fuckin point in trying if you don‚Äôt want to honestly I‚Äôve never seen anyone succeed that way in my entire life. Never. People who want it DESPERATELY and try for YEARS before they get it, like me, they need to be MORE persistent than heroin addiction. Or whatever it is they‚Äôre addicted to. they‚Äôll fail so many times before they get it right and there‚Äôs no one way to recover. Some people need to talk about it. Other people like me- I can talk about it but I generally just lead a normal life and use it to help people because it‚Äôs a vast knowledge base that I rounded out with the better part of a decade of formal education in the field. 

I don‚Äôt like to have my family bringing shit (addiction/recovery/my past) up ALL the time. They still do. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. They still sometimes treat me like a fucking incompetent invalid but it‚Äôs a family illness - a lot of dysfunction that was already present usually gets multiplied and new dysfunctions and codependencies and control complexes usually parent ‚Äî> child present themselves regardless of age.


This makes it even harder to get clean. No one can be NormaL if you don‚Äôt treat them fuckin normal, you know? Even if they are clean. It‚Äôs hard to act normal if people treat you weird all the time or bring up the worst memories you ever had constantly. Can you imagine if people talked about every most shameful experience you can think of where you wound up unintentionally hurting people because of personal choices or just any AWFUL memory - if they brought that up EVERY time you spoke to your family? Or friends? ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs a shame and sadness driven illness at its heart usually - addiction‚Ä¶. And that is very unhelpful in my opinion, to me personally. 

But I‚Äôm working with them on it lol and they‚Äôll get there in the end but it‚Äôs easier to see the dysfunction now cause I‚Äôm clean and doing nothing wrong so it‚Äôs like, Jesus Christ that‚Äôs not normal, the way you‚Äôre treating me! They don‚Äôt treat anyone else like that. But whatever - parents lol, I just have a bigger struggle than most people that‚Äôs all. Good thing I took psych that is ALL I have to say about that, without the coping skills I learned by studying and practicing them irl and doing therapy I would NEVER be as far along. It‚Äôs a lifelong constant practice of self improvement. I constantly need to monitor my mental health. For most people if they let themselves get sad enough they just i dont know gain some weight or something ‚Ä¶ I could relapse and eventually die or Maybe even die immediately since I don‚Äôt have a tolerance to the drug anymore. It‚Äôs way higher stakes.

But from all the experience I've had and from everything I've witnessed, enabling addicts (whether by giving them drugs or permitting their behaviour) just makes their lives even worse and the lives of people around them miserable. It's when life as an addict becomes just intolerable that people change. And giving them dope on demand will just keep them in a sort of limbo where they're in agony every day, but they don't have the wherewithal to stop. It's only when you hit rock bottom and you have a moment of clarity after a period, however brief, of sobriety, that change happens.

Giving people all the pure dope they want will virtually ensure that will never happen, and it will not mitigate the risk of psychosis, destructive behaviours, or OD in the long run.

Precarious housing, precarious job, bad health, social isolation, and a fuck ton of stigma.   Ohhhh, and the knowledge that if all those pressures become too much, a relapse is very possible, which will render all the work and suffering you went through in rehab moot, and stand a good chance of killing you.

I think harm reduction has created an even bigger problem in places like Vancouver, where under the guise of harm reduction, the drug problem has increased multi-fold. There is an objective failure in the way the city of Vancouver hands out ""safe"" drugs, but instead of drug addicts dying, they're just stuck in the same cycle of addiction.

The problem with harm reduction is that it's a bandaid solution that only treats the symptoms of a larger problem. When I see prhases like ""casual narcotic/opiod users"", it boggles my mind. There needs to be more emphasis on stigmatizing hard drug use, in the same way we stigmatize other societal harms like drunk driving. People really need to be made aware of the dangers of hard drug use and should be taught to avoid using them at all costs. I think more money needs to be spent on prevention/eduction.

I understand there are legitimate scenarios like elders mixing up their drugs, children using unattended drugs, etc., which in these cases it makes sense to have Naloxone kits handy. But when it's for addicts, that's just keeping them alive to allow them to further live through a vicious cycle of addiction. Very few of them actually get the help they need when there is a government sponsored program of free drugs.",t3_yjn2yi,Drugs or Alcohol

I know a lot of addicts don‚Äôt ever make it to recovery, but some do and I don‚Äôt think someone should lose their life because they accidentally took too much.

The safe drug program has basically continued the cycle of addiction for addicts. What is the point in saving someone's life if they just going to continually overdose until one day they die? It's better to invest more money in prevention/eduction and protection for the communities suffering from crime. This harm reduction measure comes at the same time when they're trying to reduce police budgets. It's the perfect storm for addicts causing trouble in communities. Vancouver needs better policing so that average Vancouverites are not collateral to all the crime caused by a drug problem (e.g. break ins, random attacks, businesses getting robbed, etc.)

8,7,"Hey, I'm a harm reduction worker.

If you see someone slumped over in an unnatural position, ESPECIALLY if they have a straight shooter, foil, or a syringe in their hand indicating they have recently used opiates, this is what you should do:

Look for signs of movement or breathing and try to look at their face - is it pink and normal looking? If yes, they're probably ok, move on. (Note - even if they are breathing but in that completely folded over frontward seated position, this can be really dangerous as it can cut off the circulation if someone stays like that for too long, so it is a good idea to rouse them if you're comfortable so at least they can momentarily shift positions).

If no signs of movement/breathing: approach them. Start with verbal cues ""hey can you hear me? Just checking if you're ok? You're just nodded out pretty hard bud, I just want to check you're ok.""

 If no response, you can move on to a gentle touch on the arm if you're comfortable, followed by increasingly firm squeezes on the trapezoids (shoulder), and louder vocal cues. If at any point they rouse move back slightly so they don't feel threatened (people harass and steal stuff from folks who are passed out all the time), reassure that you were just checking they were ok, and then move along.

If they are completely unresponsive or if you observe their skin is grey and lips are blue: This is a 911 call. If you are trained, equipped and comfortable, then at this point you should be pulling them flat onto their backs, doing sternum rubs, administering naloxone and rescue breaths and/or CPR.

I really do encourage you to check in on people who are slumped over. Last year, a 16 year old girl I worked closely with died of an overdose alone on the sidewalk, during the middle of the day. She had been there for at least 8 hours before someone realized she was dead and called 911. Hundreds of people would have walked past her.

It's really fucking scary at night when someone is irate and angry at me and I'm alone with them on the street. I would have zero recourse if they do choose to come at me. 

So if I see someone that looks wrong and is a bit too still, I will pause and try to figure out if they need help. But I'm not a nurse, I'm not a police officer, I'm not a social worker.

Addiction treatment is severely underfunded, it takes weeks/months to get into a vch funded bed at most centers. And a lot of the time it isnt feasible at all. 

Like sometimes it‚Äôs a several hour window when someone is actually willing to quit, so we need to be able to get them a bed in that time. It‚Äôs not like you can just send someone to treatment and have them get better, they have to want it and be willing to work for it. So having a system that has enough capacity that someone can get in immediately is essential, currently the only way to get in immediately is to have 5-10k lying around, which most addicts don‚Äôt have. 

For example TWC, which is supposed to be a non-profit basically only takes in people on welfare beds if they know someone who works there, or are able to pay 10k for the first month. Then the staff offer to be sober coaches for another 2k a month, preying on people who are desperate to get sober. And if someone relapsed while they‚Äôre there on government assistance they have to pay another 5-10k to get back in. Its a place that‚Äôs supposed to be helping people, but seems to be morally bankrupt.

More people getting treated than becoming homeless would slowly reduce the overall number of homeless people.

And it makes sense economically because when someone gets back on their feet they spend the rest of their working life paying taxes, easily paying back the amount that was spent treating them. And then they also contribute to the economy by working further benefitting all other Canadians. 

Someone on welfare in treatment has approximately $1500 a month that the government is paying towards treatment. So even if they‚Äôre in treatment for a year, that would only be like 3 years of taxes at minimum wage to pay back what they got in services. If someone is able to make above minimum wage that number is further reduced.

8,7,"You can't ""abuse"" the BC Housing list. It's a combination of many factors such as low numbers of subsidized units, long turn around on refurbishing vacant units due to extreme damage and bureaucracy. There's also a focus on trying to get people from the street to a home, rather than transferring people that are already housed. When you transfer someone, you essentially take up two units for one person for a period of time. There's also the fact that a lot of transfers are medically motivated. Live in a building without an elevator and end up with a mobility issue causing you to need a walker or chair? BCH will transfer you to a building with an elevator and medical urgency trumps other reasons for moving and even trumps able bodied homeless people. 

It's not an easy system to manage and while it should and could be much faster, it just isn't.

8,7,"*Edited for kindness

I strongly disagree. I'm a paramedic who goes to a lot of overdoses, and sometimes they're repeat customers. That doesn't make their lives worth less. And they're definitely not overdosing more because of naloxone. They're overdosing because they have had awful, awful lives that have given them a searing psychological pain they can't handle, and the drugs they use have an unpredictable amount of fentanyl mixed in with the baking soda and ground glass. So yeah, when we get them back from an overdose, they go right back to using. Obviously. We didn't un-rape the five-year-old version of themselves, we didn't give the kid who raised themselves a new set of coping skills, and we didn't give the unmedicated schizophrenic the care that the province owes him. We definitely didn't make the next fentanyl they buy have a more predictable dose. But to suggest that the reason these traumatized, broken people keep overdosing is because they're ""emboldened"" by naloxone... it misses the mark.

/u/V_imaginary, you're exactly right. People don't want to be naloxoned if they can help it. They wake up feeling all of their pain again, sometimes in withdrawal. But it's worth doing if someone's overdosed. These people have friends that will grieve for them, like the guys who were with your patient today.",t3_xjrjgu,Drugs or Alcohol

One: this problem needs to be addressed with classification of need. Vancouver has the problem that they treat all people in need the same. The mentally challenged individual who just needs some care and support is being housed with the violent schizophrenic meth head.

The in recovery, former prostitute can't be classes the same as the drug dealing pimp, they cannot be neighbour's. 

I fully agree with NIMBY's if the risk is your neighborhood is suddenly going to be sacrificed to the God of virtue signaling, forced to deal with a cities problems. But if the idea is, the neighborhood is getting housing for single mothers, or persons with disabilities that do not have conditions of violence tied to them, it's much harder to argue against that. Hell I'll admit, I moved and when I heard they were building low income housing nearby, I wrote the city to confirm what it meant. I get both sides of the argument.

Two: There is money  it's just poorly spent. We've allowed cracktavists to take ahold of the pot and not let go. Millions goes into the DTES and it's unchecked.

>We can't destroy the city to cater to the bottom 0.5%. Give them the support, but consequences for bad behavior too. Just like everyone's favorite model, Portugal.

The problem is that the causes of poverty and ultimately drug addiction are multitudinous and systematic - the precise problem is that an increasing number of people are falling through the cracks in Canada's social welfare systems, and they're ending up on the street and on drugs as a result of a lack of access to housing, healthcare (both physical and mental) and counselling. I fail to see how defunding social programs even further and making the cracks wider is going to resolve the issue.

Also, there *are* consequences to bad behaviour. It's not like people in the DTES are running around murdering people and getting away with it because the police can't try poor people for crimes. Just like you can't solve the problem by cutting funding for the solution, you don't solve the problem by excessively punishing poor people either. A lot of people end up homeless by circumstance, and that puts them at higher incidence for drug use because being homeless they also have harder times accessing basic services.

It will never cease to amaze me how the problem is so clear, everyone recognizes that it's a problem, yet when it comes to properly addressing it no one wants to actually do anything about it. If you're fed up with drug users and homeless people in Vancouver, then you need to be an advocate for solving the issues at the root - creating a robust social welfare system in Canada that addresses homelessness at the moment it happens, providing counselling and a sense of community to people, and if someone is already an addict, providing them the means to address their addiction and to help them out of it.",t3_qd7f5x,Drugs or Alcohol

9,7,"Mental health is a big one. It's not just therapy that is needed either. Transportation to and from, money for potential medications, more access to mental health resources for adults, etc. 

Our mental health care system in Canada is pathetic. 

My medication for ADHD without any insurance was $177.67/month. It just jumped up to $192.03 without any warning. Many people self medicate for a variety of mental health issues. That's why. 

Let's have people care enough about others. 

Safe injection sites were a good idea. People didn't like them because instead of the random addict you'd come across, there would be a collection of them outside the site. People don't like seeing things that aren't pleasing to the eye. 

Let's open shelters so that our homeless who have pets have somewhere to stay.

In all reality OP, we will never eradicate homelessness. Not enough people care, and those who do don't always do enough. myself included, and I fully admit that. Our government doesn't care enough. Those who are in positions to help (the wealthy, big corporations, etc) don't want to help. 
And not everyone wants to be helped. We as a society have created a huge stigma surrounding homelessness, addiction, and mental health issues that it will take decades to change it all.

9,7,"Hello.  I experienced periods of homelessness as a teenager, so I am somewhat aware of the challenges.  I was grateful for the grey nuns in Vancouver who stood on the street handing out peanut butter sandwiches.  Hunger changes your brain, and after the third day without food you can't make intelligent choices. At first, I survived on condiments, but I started panhandling to avoid the obvious alternatives for a teenage girl on the street. So I always give to panhandlers, no matter how broke I feel.  For me, that was 40 years ago and I recovered.  Here is my report on what I observe today:

I talk to the people on the street.  I don't meet many Indigenous, but the other day I met a young Indigenous man.  I referred myself to the article I read posted here from CBC.  The closing quote was something like: If you see an Indigenous person asking for money just give it to them and allow them to retain their independence, or something like that.  I am skeptical of that, it sounded like a heist from the speaker and a reason for the tribes to continue ignoring their own.  But you know, I talked to him for a bit and gave him some money.  His story was that his tribe had kicked him out and he had no one on the reserve.  I asked him how he was doing alone, and he told me he was tired.  Tired of fighting, tired of the cops hassling him, tired of the Pakistanis beating him up.  He said he's tired of getting beat, he said he shot a boy in the face three times and he thinks he's dead.   He doesn't want to remember any of it.  He faded out and I cut it there.  I haven't seen him since.

A woman (whom I haven't seen this year!) usually sleeps at a spot I know, I have given her my coat and some money in the past.  Her issue is transit tickets.  Why the city bothers to write tickets to the homeless I don't know.  They can't pay it, and they can't access the resources because of outstanding tickets.

Young Indigenous men around the Peter Lougheed who are more local tell me that they can't go home because their mothers and aunties are violent drunks.  They are hustling, so..., but i hear it a lot.

Stepfathers.  Alcoholic mothers.  A parent in prison.  

I met a young Indigenous man at the Foothills in 2019.  He had a stab 
wound on his calf.  An old man on the reserve asked him to help mow the lawn and got drunk while the kid worked.  The old man went into a rage and stabbed the boy in his leg.  As the Foot Hills is a filthy hole, the boy got a post op infection and lost his leg below the knee.  We chatted quite a bit at the smoking bench, I asked him what he would do next.  Would he go to school, for example?  He said that Social Services would pay tuition and accommodation, etc, but if he accepted that, he would be a kind of sell out with his friends.  I think he felt they would crash his place and ruin it for him.  He was a beautiful boy, with such a bright smile.  Last year I read a news story about a young Indigenous man with one leg who pushed an old man onto the c train track in a rage, or somesuch violent act. I thought of him and felt sick.  

The older man I speak to admits he gets money but he has a drinking problem.  I give him food.  And a smoke or two.

Solutions?

1) How about the churches get off their asses and make some sandwiches.  Those nuns in Vancouver saved me from a life of horror with some stale bread and peanut butter.  

2) Stop criminalizing poverty.  Don't issue tickets for troubles related to homelessness.

3)More shelters with better conditions. 

4)More indoor public spaces that are free.  I stayed warm in libraries and museums in my time.

5)Access to drinking water.

6)We need a public bath house, where the homeless can shower and clean their clothes.  The husky truck stops do it for drivers.  Shower, food, laundry all in a gas station.  We could offer that with a soup kitchen.

7)An outreach block parent call number, where a kid can get a judgement free ride home.  Especially needed for kids who come in from the reserve.  

8)Tackle the age old problem of can't get help without a fixed address, can't get an address without help

That's my take on it.

So many people are one missed paycheque away from being homeless. We need more services to help keep them off the streets and help them ""get back on the horse"".

Just spitballing but what about something like a small but private room of their own that is ""free"" for 6 months. That gives them a home address and a phone which are critical for getting a job.

When it comes to heroin, assuming the drug supply is clean, addicts (or, more medically accurate, those who are dependent on heroin) can be some of the most functional members of society.

When it comes to opiates, the problem is not the drug itself... the problem is the lack of the drug.

Give opiate addicts a clean and regulated supply at an affordable price and make it legal, and most of them would be functioning tax paying citizens, and no more criminal, or likely to be homeless than the general population.

Heroin addicts typically become dysfunctional when they have to spend their whole lives trying to find the money to get more drugs, while simultaneously being shunned by everyone who cares about them.    This desperation due to chemical dependence can create some truly destructive behaviour...  Because, the amygdala is involved.   A heroin addicts brain convinces them that heroin is basically like food, and not having it, is them starving to death.   Lack of opiates triggers a level of desperation that goes beyond psychological, into straight up panic caused by the brain sending signals that the addict is DYING.    And if you were starving to death, what would you be willing to do to get food?   Probably, close to anything.

However, just like feeding people stops them from stealing food, (or other anti-social behaviors to get money to buy food) just freaking GIVING the heroin user their drugs stops them from destroying their lives.

They already are selling out in the open. There are numerous spots in the city where police will not arrest them for drug dealing. 

Also, if you carry small amounts, you have to stay near your trap house/stash spot to replenish your supply. Seems like that would help the cops build a case against these people.

These religious rules were attempts at encouraging behaviour that they believed would create more stable families and communities (especially once the destabilizing effects of drug addiction became clearer). They were not etched in stone, but emerged in many cultures (Islamic, Confucian, Buddhist and Christian alike) over time as opiates evolved from beneficial medicinal aids to sources of widespread addiction.

I don't disagree that many, many drug laws were introduced due to racism. Hell, we're talking about heroin here, anti-opium laws in the US and Canada were pretty closely linked to anti-Chinese sentiment. But keep in mind, similar laws (and many harsher) were first introduced in China due to the effects that opium was having on social relations. In fact Chinese officials often appealed to the contradictions with supposed British Victorian morality in their pleas to stop the import of opium. 

What I'm against is what I perceive as increasingly liberal or, if you want to use more moralistic terms, 'permissive' attitudes towards what many people have long understood as very dangerous drugs. This has less to do with being punitive to people dealing with addiction, and more taking seriously the truly negative *consequences* of addiction both personally and socially.

I think it's pretty obvious that my bias is towards social stability and societies with extremely high prison populations are not known for being incredibly stable.

Here's something that's probably seen as controversial but I don't think should be, the primary purpose of drug laws is not *to be racist*. As I admitted many were laws were influenced by racism, many were enforced in racist ways. But these measures often began with very high degrees of support from the communities that were impacted the most by addiction (and consequently enforcement). Even prohibition, despite being motivated by anti-Catholic attitudes, was trying to address the very real issue of domestic violence due to alcoholism.

My objection isn't to decriminalization per say. It's to the modern approach of removing laws seen as unfair without addressing the underlying problem the law was trying to solve address. That's how I view the approach taken in the DTES, San Francisco, Seattle and many other cities where the drug problem is clearly getting worse despite massive investment into treatment.

Despite your references to puritanism, my point is that prohibitions on drugs are extremely widespread. If you visit China today their laws against drug possession and trafficking are harsher than any in North America (not to say that makes them *good* just that this isn't exclusively a Western thing). I believe it is naive to think that the many communities across time, geography, and culture arrived at these prohibitions irrationally. Moralism doesn't just mean 'punitive' - it's a system of governing social relations.

I don't think we disagree that the war on drugs has been a failure.

I do, however, agree with a blanket decriminalization of simple possession and consumption of all drugs, with the establishment of safe consumption sites and supply, as a harm reduction measure with an increased access to drug rehabilitation programming. Ideally we don't have a population that's at the mercy of their addictions and we should be working towards that.

Right now we need to access a doctor to get a prescription for legitimate long term or recurring use of drugs (such as birth control and thyroid meds). Having a doctor *available* is obviously best for all sorts of reasons, but I question their value as gate keepers and the power it gives them. Also, we don't have enough doctor hours, so let's save their time for when people actually want their help. This would also remove the whole discussion of whether a patient is only seeing a physician because they are ""drug seeking"" (from what I hear ""drug seeking"" behaviour drives a lot of ERs visits).

Pharmacies are already required to provide information with all drugs, so the education component would be covered. Keep the more potent drugs over-the-counter and document them; we already have IT infrastructure for this in MB with DPIN. With drug history tracked, pharmacists can inform about interactions (OP might be sophisticated enough to figure them out, most people aren't), and physicians can take them into account when seeing patients.

Some drugs also have benefits to their use, like psylicibin, and people should be able to choose if they want to try them. Also more research could be done on the drugs themselves if they were actually legal. I also find it ridiculous how common and accepted drinking is, compared to doing drugs. Especially marijuana.

7,9,"Very good point and in the case of heroin it really doesn‚Äôt deserve the reputation it has compared to other opioids. The reason we see heroin as heroin is because it‚Äôs the opioid of choice for the poor and the one most prevalent on the street. If oxycodone or hydromorphone or really any other opioid came as a cheap powder on the street it would have the same reputation and if H only came in pharmaceutical pills we‚Äôd look at it differently as well. Heroin isn‚Äôt really special but we view it as the big bad almighty devil drug that will ruin your life in one foul swoop but most of the problems associated with H come from it being illegal and I hope one day we can come to view these things in an objective way and promote safe use of drugs in the same way we have learned to tame alcohol which is arguably more dangerous.

As for unregulatable drugs in general I think no but what comes to mind are ultra potent substances like fentanyl, nitazenes, bromo-dragonfly, nbome compounds, etc which if sold would have to be sold in predosed amounts rather than pure powder form so either pills, tabs, patches (like pharmaceutical fentanyl), volumetric solutions, etc. Ig things that are less drug like and more so direct poisons is a different matter but that‚Äôs a pretty niche subject and not really practical like whether someone should be able to buy mass quantities of cyanide idk not my expertise lol. Short answer is not really, with today‚Äôs technology we can produce drugs that are predosed and prepared for safer RoAs as well. For example promote the oral or nasal use of heroin over smoking/injection or having tighter controls over that route of administration. Creating designer drugs that are more suitable for recreation could be the future as well like with lisdexamphetamine (Vyvanse) we have seen the power of prodrugs and how careful drug design can limit abuse potential but yeah that‚Äôs maybe a touch off topic at this point xD

When you give people choices and opportunities they don‚Äôt tend to want the drugs. Meth isn‚Äôt really that special either compared to other stims, maybe to a degree because higher dopamine compared to norepinephrine release and also a bit of sert activity but it‚Äôs comparable to dextroamphetamine when given in equivalent doses.

7,9,Sure so in terms of overdose risk no opioids are definitely more dangerous in that respect HOWEVER in terms of toxicity and long term health detriments alcohol takes the cake. It‚Äôs both a carcinogen and hepatotoxic whereas opioids are considered virtually non toxic and have little damage to physical health (assuming we‚Äôre talking pure substances of course). So in case of the casual heroin user vs casual alcohol user it will be the alcohol user who is damaged more. If one is using normal dosages for each alcohol is much more harmful and toxic. Mixing the two is the worst case tho as that can easily produce fatal respiratory depression and I‚Äôd be curious to see how many opioid overdose deaths include other depressants into the mix cause if you are being reasonable with dose and know you have a clean product you can easily prevent overdose.,t3_yxwc33,Drugs or Alcohol

>Take this anecdotel evidence how you will, but one of the offenders I've worked with has said that the legalization of weed has been the best thing for the black market.

7,9,"I'm in favour of legalization of some drugs for recreational use, but to address your specific example of using opiods recreationally, I've seen too many lives ruined by stuff like legally perscribed opiods (oxy, vicodin, etc.) that I don't think they should be legal for recreational use. This goes for any highly addictive drug in my mind. I'm even of the mindset that we need to curb recreational alcohol consumption somehow. I'm by no means a policy expert though, so I'm not sure what the best way to accomplish that would be.

I am, however, a mental health professional. The social and mental health impacts of drug addiction don't end when something becomes legalized for recreational use. I work with a lot of folks battling addiction and it's hard to advocate for any plan that would increase access for people to take up these substances recreationally. 

I have immense amount of synpathy for folks who are already battling addiction and we need to take every measure to help them, but in the ideal world my mind imagines when looking at drug use in our society there is no drug use at all. That's obviously too idealistic to be realistic, but I can't advocate for a system that expands access for the use of these drugs to people who aren't currently battling addiction.",t3_yxwc33,Drugs or Alcohol

That being said I would argue that it‚Äôs much easier to see the downsides to these drugs as the horrendous addictions are very visible much of the time at least in some of the worst cases. What‚Äôs not visible is the person who takes the same drugs and goes to work, has a family, meets their responsibilities in life and uses responsibly because you would never tell. There‚Äôs also people in heavy addiction who maintain all that too who ought to be helped but it‚Äôs very clear, the majority of users of ANY drug are not addicts (once again referencing the work of Carl Hart who I highly recommend listening to if you‚Äôre interested). I see you are someone who cares deeply for those effected by addictions but my counter point is this, the best thing to prevent the harms of addiction would be legalization. No that won‚Äôt end addiction I don‚Äôt think anything ultimately will but it will have a drastic effect on overdose deaths and health complications caused by dirty street garbage. Yes prescription pills can be just as dangerous don‚Äôt get me wrong and I certainly am not a fan of the abuse of companies like Perdue but once again it‚Äôs not the drug that is the problem in the end it is simply a means. Certain drugs having high risks to them is not an argument against legalization it‚Äôs an argument for it. People will do drugs and potentially become addicted to them no matter what we do there is no stopping it, it‚Äôs simply a part of human existence.

7,9,In terms of preventing overdose education is obviously very important. As an opioid user myself I can tell you I do not want to take too high of a dose as it will cause me to get sick and possibly vomit so there is some self regulation there. If someone wants to take a ridiculous dose I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much we can do to stop them at least as a matter of policy cause they already can go ahead and do that so it‚Äôs hard for me to say. We need to teach people to be responsible with whatever drug they are using and treat addicts with compassion and hopefully proper treatment. With drinking there are those who can have a couple drinks and enjoy themselves and those who get blackout but in general as a society we try to push for the former and teach people how to use alcohol responsibly (at least in theory) I believe we could do the same with other substances but there‚Äôs no perfect solution of course.,t3_yxwc33,Drugs or Alcohol
7,9,"Doesn‚Äôt surprise me, overdoses involving single substances tend to be rare and involve recklessness or are accidental like for example someone who was tolerant to IV heroin use receiving a stronger batch and using their regular dose in the shot would be at risk or if they took a break from use they might overestimate how much tolerance they have in the first place.

7,9,"That's actually a misconception.  It's very easy to kill yourself with alcohol.  The LD50 is a BAC around 0.4%, and the effective dose is .05-.25.  Think about that.  A fatal dose is as little as 2x what some people consume on a night of heavy drinking.

The only reason we don't have an epidemic of alcohol related poisonings is that we have same supply, safe consumption sites, and considerable education around the dangers of drinking.

In terms of habitual use, alcohol is extremely toxic when compared to many other drugs.

The bulk of the risk from street drugs comes from their street nature, not the drug itself.",t3_yxwc33,Drugs or Alcohol

7,9,"Unfortunately the ""legalization prevents harm from drug use"" isn't borne out in the cases we have to look at. Alcohol is actually a very apt analog for this, as it's an addictive substances on par with opiates. Alcohol accounts for the vast majority of drug use issues, with 16% of people over the age of 12 in Canada being considered ""heavy drinkers"", which is 1 in 4 of the total population of Canadian drinkers, and accounts for nearly 15,000 preventable deaths in Canada each year. That's a massively negative impact.

Legalizing drugs can reduce some harm, a lot of that is because of safe supply which decriminalized models provide, but it in no way ""prevents harm"" as you put it. It can reduce deaths from bad cuts containing toxic addatives or stronger substances like fent, but it doesn't come close to solving the plethora of other issues associated with addiction.

I also think it's very naive, and kind of insulting, to assume that I've only seen the extreme cases of drug use and have no understanding of functioning drug users. As a professional working in this field I understand the landscape of drug use in this country very well and have many friends and colleagues who use recreationally or are functioning addicts.

Still, most people who drink are safe responsible users and should be allowed to do as they please with their own bodies. You do mention that you support safe supply but I‚Äôm curious as to what defines safe supply and legalization to you because to me legalization is just extending safe supply to everyone who wants to partake whereas safe supply programs are typically quite limited in terms of who has access.

In my mind it's very clear that harsh and long prison sentences for non-violent drug crimes has been tried and tried again, both in the US and Canada. The evidence is overwhelming that it did not work. Does ""the war on drugs"" ring a bell? I genuinely think that your beliefs on this issue are akin to people who still think teaching abstinence only sex-ed to teens words to deter pregnancy. Both of those issues have a similar track record of working out, and advocates of both seem to be more motivated by their person moral outrage rather than effective public health policy.",t3_r5rtiz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,9,"Firstly, 40 months in custody for trafficking heroin/fentanyl and possessing a loaded/restricted firearm is not a ""harsh and long prison sentence"".

Secondly, the main issue in for-profit drug-trafficking is general deterrence, not denunciation/specific deterrence (we currently have a pandemic of drug trafficking, heroin-related deaths, along with gang/gun murders in our community, but you apparently have not noticed). But-for this fellow's racial background, 40 months i/c would be a very reasonable sentence.

Thirdly, I most certainly carry a high level of moral outrage against those who traffic death via heroin (for profit), and who use guns/bullet proof vests as part of that business. I have seen enough death and mayhem to convince me, and I don't need to pretend that the next armed drug trafficker is somehow an exception to the already ghastly rule.

Finally, the characterization of armed heroin traffickers as being ""non-violent"" is absurd. The resulting death is all around us, this offender would be the first to explain why he had a loaded firearm and bullet-proof vest (\*hint\* it's not because he thinks that this activity is ""non-violent""), and even the dimmest of drug traffickers fully knows what is happening to their customers out there as result of their criminal activity.",t3_r5rtiz,Drugs or Alcohol
8,9,"In response to your first point: I disagree, and evidently the judge did as well. 3.5 years in prison is a long time for a first time offender with a non-violent crime. I also find it a bit offensive to assume I ""haven't noticed"" the epidemic of ODs in our community. I have personally had several family members and friends struggle with addiction, some of them did not survive. 

Secondly, research has shown time and time and *time* again that longer prison sentences do not reduce crime. Not on an individual level, not on a societal level. Some studies show longer sentences actually *increase* recidivism rates. It makes sense, prison is traumatizing, and in general traumatized people are more likely to have a difficult time re-integrating into society.

Thirdly, I think we're getting a bit hyperbolic here. Non-violent crime has a societal and legal definition, and nobody in this case was arguing that he committed a violent crime. You're being harsher on this guy than even the prosecutors of his case. Is smuggling guns across the border a violent crime, because those guns could be used to commit violence? What about selling alcohol to minors? They could get alcohol poisoning and die, people do every day. But we don't describe those crimes as violent because that's not what the term means, legally or societally.",t3_r5rtiz,Drugs or Alcohol

I don‚Äôt know how anyone can look around Vancouver and honestly think ‚Äúbasic needs are taken care of‚Äù. Respectfully, I think this is very far from being true. Many, many people in Vancouver have unmet basic needs; affordable housing, the inflation at the grocery store, social isolation and loneliness as a result of poverty, mental health or childhood developmental problems stemming from the COVID pandemic, a health care system that is completely over burdened because COVID created many new people who need health care services but government has not responded with new money.

My experience - A few weeks ago I was picking up takeout as a payday treat. While walking home, some dudes comes up to me asking if I can spare any money. I'm carrying a takeout order, so I feel like I can't blatantly lie and say 'no', so I offer to buy him a meal. He tells me he's banned from every place that serves food in the area. üôÑ Asks for money again, saying he's on a breakfast program at a shelter and that he can stretch the money for more food there. He's even bold enough to offer to walk me to an ATM!   
1. I'm already intimidated (even tho he's not threatening me), I'm a small young woman all alone, and he's this big, hulking homeless guy.   
2. I want to believe in the best in people and that he's telling me the truth about wanting to buy cheap breakfasts. Even if he was lying, I still have empathy for people struggling (whether it's with addiction, homelessness, or just hunger in general), so I gave him the only $10 I had in my wallet.

Actually that's the sad part. 99% of them will never do anything but be an addict ever again. If life was hard for them before becoming an addict then the chance of them being the 30% that recovers and the even smaller percent that don't relapse and manage to pull thier life together. Well, it's very slim if no one is helping them in a big way. There's a lot we can improve here as a society and it would benefit more than just recovering addicts. For example many express that they have no chance of meaningful work if they recover. We offer free highschool upgrading now but the risk involved in post secondary is a huge barrier. We mostly house our addicts, recovering addicts and disabled in the same housing. A recovering addict living in social housing that probably has an inhouse drug dealer as well as dozens of addicts living with them is essentially doomed.

He scared a woman she looked at me for help, I stepped between them and person was all like ""I dunno why I do this?"" Then they proceeded to try and put their arm around my neck in I dunno a weird-ass hug/headlock? I had none of that shit and stated: ""Don't fucking touch me."" Swatted the druggie away while he tried ranting something.... for all I know he was trying to rob me or hug me.

8,9,"You're pretty funny. 

I lived in Strathcona for 12 years, from 2010 to 2021, and periodically worked there for a couple years previous. 

It was pretty decent near the the start of that period, and continued to improve until about 2018, when crime and street disorder started to get to be more noticeable. Typically I got hit with a theft about once a year in that time. 

I'd walk Pender St to the CBD everyday before more of the cleanup happens when the businesses open. The amount of turds on the street, broken windows, and garbage steadily increased after 2018. 

Then the pandemic hit, and the park encampment moved in. In a period of about 4 or 5 months I chased a few people prowling my front yard off, had multiple vehicle break-ins, had yard furniture get repeatedly stolen (which was bolted to my house), had randos take a swipe at me while walking downtown, and a bunch of other crap happen. Nothing says safe neighbourhood like hearing propane tank explosions from several blocks away. 

I had 3 or 4 calls to the police non-emergency line go unanswered. No email responses back. No case numbers. Nada. 

So when the opportunity to move in with my partner happened, I asked her if she wanted to move into my neighbourhood? The answer was a solid nope, but I can't blame her. So I left.",t3_y5nfia,Drugs or Alcohol

I went to Top of the World Ranch for 6 weeks and have been clean from cocaine since. The success rate was roughly 50/50.

I followed up rehab with multiple AA meetings every week for 2.5 years.

9,9,"I had a bad alcohol addiction. I think they are different enough beasts that I am not sure what advice will be useful. I‚Äôll try to be as general as possible. 

The first year after quitting drinking I felt like I was walking around without skin. I was so vulnerable and I had no coping mechanisms. Everything hurt emotionally and I had to learn so much about coping, difficulty, shame, sadness. It was so uncomfortable sitting with these things. I did it alone, I didn‚Äôt attend my first meeting till I was 6 years sober and my first thought is it would have been so much easier if I had gone at the beginning. There is a lot of support there. You can feel crazy struggling with addiction and struggling with sobriety. Being in that room you are reminded that you are not alone and there is a massive world of people that get it. Try different meetings till you find one that clicks - for you. Download the meeting guide app if you have a smart phone - no shortage of meetings to try.

Quitting is hard. I still have to work hard 6 years later. It‚Äôs easier now but when things get tough I have to remind myself that addiction was a lot of work too. Life is hard we don‚Äôt get to choose no work we only get to choose which kind of work we do. This is corny but I wake up in the morning and say ‚Äúthis is the best work I‚Äôll ever do‚Äù. Maybe this makes more sense as a tip for an alcoholic maintaining an opiate addiction seems like a stupid amount of work so maybe it‚Äôs obvious.

Most people fail to get sober. If you just roll the dice chances are you will never get clean. Some people see that as demotivating. The lesson that I took was that I need to do everything in my power to stack the deck in my favour as possible. Anything you can do to make it as simple as possible to stay sober you need to do. 

The day I actually got sober was shitty. It wasn‚Äôt the worst day I actually had with alchohol. I did a lot of shitty things while I was drunk or in order to get drunk or in order to stay addicted. The day I got sober was just a really bad hangover and some drunk driving the night before on the scale of bad nights that makes it about 3/10. The difference was that the feeing in my mind was ‚ÄúI will do ANYTHING in my power to never feel this way again‚Äù. I made that my mantra and that is what got me sober. For all the people I know who are clean from any substance they all have a similar story or mantra. The people who I know who are not successful didn‚Äôt think the same. I know that some people don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cool any more ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care I said I would give up anything‚Äù I damaged my relationship with my father getting sober ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care I said I would give up anything‚Äù I failed university classes cost myself a lot of time, trouble and money ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care I said I would give up anything‚Äù.

My life is awesome now yours can be too. I have an amazing wife (super hot too), a white collar job, a degree in mathematics. This was the trade though ‚ÄúI gave up alcohol for everything else, before I gave up everything else for alcohol‚Äù I still get tempted I love alchohol more than anything else. The trick is I don‚Äôt love it more than everything else. As in I would trade my job for alchohol, I would give up my wife for alchohol, I would trade my mental health for alchohol, etc, ect, ect. I just refuse to trade everything at once for alchohol and that‚Äôs what my addiction demanded. So I can have everything else or I can have the thing that I loved the most. You might meet someone that can casually use opiates and that‚Äôs going to piss you off because the truth is it‚Äôs super unfair. You can‚Äôt use them because you like them more than the other person does. The drugs are wasted on them, you would love them and enjoy them more. You‚Äôre a different person now though. You are entering the phase of your life where you pick everything else over the one thing though. It‚Äôs an amazing trade if you can make a life of it. Trade one thing and gain the world. Trade one thing. 

Good fucking luck though. You gotta be strong. You gotta be commited. You gotta be strategic. You gotta be stubborn. You have to be completely different. Never quit, remember this is hard work but it‚Äôs the best work. You will do anything to be sober. You‚Äôre going to give up one thing and gain everything.",t3_zo3g0u,Drugs or Alcohol
9,9,"I did it cold turkey on my own, was extremely difficult looking back a rehab center with proper treatment would have been extremely beneficial. I'm now struggling to not relapse as I just stopped using and never took care of the issues of why I was using. I'm going through counseling and therapy currently for PTSD from a near fatal workplace accident, the counselor is going in very deep and bringing back up memories of traumas that lead to my substance abuse as well as new ones that resulted in my PTSD. It's all just so overwhelming, I'd highly suggest doing it properly to take care of the root of the problem instead of doing what I did.

I've had actual ongoing contact with this person in the past and cannot,  due to that experience,  trust him in any way, shape or form. If any of my family needed intervention for drugs or alcohol,  I would go anywhere else,  and spend whatever it took to avoid this person and his techniques. 
I realize what his thesis was on, but that doesn't make him a high quality professional in this type of thing.  Reading what some others have said about the way he did things,  I can totally see where they are coming from.... and I'm sure he has had some successes... but at what cost to their mental health?
To me he is a manipulative person only in it for himself.... he found his grift.
He may not be this to others...each to their own. No harm and no foul with our short discussion I hope.

Have a great Christmas season.",t3_zo3g0u,Drugs or Alcohol
