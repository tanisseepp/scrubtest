Also, some people are capable of holding a job and doing well in life. Suppose a grown adult wants to do acid on the weekends to relax. That's their business, and there should be regulation involved to decrease overdoses for everyone. I think both sex work and drugs should be legalized and regulated by our government.

Allowing thousands of addicts to camp in public, handing them clean needles, cash, drugs, places to stay and asking for no responsibility is not working whatsoever.

"We need to drop the woke ""always compromise effectiveness to find the nicest solution"" nonsense.

They need involuntary rehab just like Portugal. There's no point in getting rid of drug stigma if there isn't this end game in mind. It doesn't matter if they aren't ready - they are criminals. Dry out and try again. Life is too short to accept that people should throw away 5 years living in their own bodily waste on the street. It's a human indignity.

Families want their sick kids, fathers, mothers, brothers etc home and healthy, not methed out in the gutter all winter with a juice box and sandwich. 

Believing in people is hard. Glorifying their long drawn out suicide is not an essential stop on the road to recovery. It's certainly the easiest and nicest path, but its clearly the most harmful. The homeless mortality rate is now 40 times worse than the situation harm reduction claimed it was going to fix 15 years ago. Harm reduction kills, it is genocide. Housing first? Over 80% of overdose fatalities happen alone in a house. Housing is a death sentence for many addicts without real professional help. It's not surprising Housing first initiatives don't reduce harm. Homeless is the symptom not the cause of drug addiction.

 Pumping methadone into addicts then telling them there's nothing wrong is gaslighting a population so messed up that they can't take care of themselves, and then calling it a cure. No different than training drivers to operate their vehicles better while wasted to curb drinking and driving deaths. The result was always going to be so painfully obvious but Marxist thought prevailed despite its non-stop failures every time it's implemented. 

These people are sick, are not in control of their own cognition, and need institutional help. Not a mitt full of clean syringes and a granola bar.

In reality, most people consume alcohol, and the majority do so responsibly.

The problem is that the issues of unknown potency/contaminants are deadly, and that's completely caused by the street nature.  I hear that you directly see the harm yourself.  If we could snap our fingers and make opiate abuse disappear, of course we'd do it, but we can't.  We live in a world where we can live with opiate use WITH lots of death, or opiate use with few deaths.

Still doesn‚Äôt make sense. Addiction is not a product of pharmacology. Fentanyl itself is well known as being a shitty opioid and not very desirable compared to morphinan derived ones. The main pull is financial. Fent is dirt cheap and highly potent making it an easy switch from lower potency opioids to fent once it becomes too cost prohibitive. As for putting it in psychostimulants like coke I don‚Äôt understand it outside of accidental contaminations and/or fucking insane morons thinking it‚Äôll make it more marketable in a similar way that tucci (a stupid ass combination drug typically made up of ketamine and mdma and any other shit the dealer wants to use and then coloured with food dyes to make it stand out).
